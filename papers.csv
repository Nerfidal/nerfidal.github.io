high-quality Gaussian splatting assets in under one second. Turbo3D employs a
rapid 4-step, 4-view diffusion generator and an efficient feed-forward Gaussian
reconstructor, both operating in latent space. The 4-step, 4-view generator is
a student model distilled through a novel Dual-Teacher approach, which
encourages the student to learn view consistency from a multi-view teacher and
photo-realism from a single-view teacher. By shifting the Gaussian
reconstructor's inputs from pixel space to latent space, we eliminate the extra
image decoding time and halve the transformer sequence length for maximum
efficiency. Our method demonstrates superior 3D generation results compared to
previous baselines, while operating in a fraction of their runtime.";Hanzhe Hu<author:sep>Tianwei Yin<author:sep>Fujun Luan<author:sep>Yiwei Hu<author:sep>Hao Tan<author:sep>Zexiang Xu<author:sep>Sai Bi<author:sep>Shubham Tulsiani<author:sep>Kai Zhang;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04470v1;cs.CV;project page: https://turbo-3d.github.io/;gaussian splatting

applications. This paper tackles the dual challenges of dynamic novel-view
synthesis and 3D geometry reconstruction by introducing a hybrid framework:
Deformable Gaussian Splatting and Dynamic Neural Surfaces (DGNS), in which both
modules can leverage each other for both tasks. During training, depth maps
generated by the deformable Gaussian splatting module guide the ray sampling
for faster processing and provide depth supervision within the dynamic neural
surface module to improve geometry reconstruction. Simultaneously, the dynamic
neural surface directs the distribution of Gaussian primitives around the
surface, enhancing rendering quality. To further refine depth supervision, we
introduce a depth-filtering process on depth maps derived from Gaussian
rasterization. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that DGNS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view synthesis and 3D
reconstruction.";Xuesong Li<author:sep>Jinguang Tong<author:sep>Jie Hong<author:sep>Vivien Rolland<author:sep>Lars Petersson;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03910v1;cs.CV;;gaussian splatting

is relatively under-explored. It requires incremental on-the-fly updates to a
volumetric representation, fast training and rendering to satisfy real-time
constraints and a small memory footprint for efficient transmission. If
achieved, it can enhance user experience by enabling novel applications, e.g.,
3D video conferencing and live volumetric video broadcast, among others. In
this work, we propose a novel framework for QUantized and Efficient ENcoding
(QUEEN) for streaming FVV using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). QUEEN directly
learns Gaussian attribute residuals between consecutive frames at each
time-step without imposing any structural constraints on them, allowing for
high quality reconstruction and generalizability. To efficiently store the
residuals, we further propose a quantization-sparsity framework, which contains
a learned latent-decoder for effectively quantizing attribute residuals other
than Gaussian positions and a learned gating module to sparsify position
residuals. We propose to use the Gaussian viewspace gradient difference vector
as a signal to separate the static and dynamic content of the scene. It acts as
a guide for effective sparsity learning and speeds up training. On diverse FVV
benchmarks, QUEEN outperforms the state-of-the-art online FVV methods on all
metrics. Notably, for several highly dynamic scenes, it reduces the model size
to just 0.7 MB per frame while training in under 5 sec and rendering at 350
FPS.

in scenes featuring transient objects is challenging. We propose a novel hybrid
representation, termed as HybridGS, using 2D Gaussians for transient objects
per image and maintaining traditional 3D Gaussians for the whole static scenes.
Note that, the 3DGS itself is better suited for modeling static scenes that
assume multi-view consistency, but the transient objects appear occasionally
and do not adhere to the assumption, thus we model them as planar objects from
a single view, represented with 2D Gaussians. Our novel representation
decomposes the scene from the perspective of fundamental viewpoint consistency,
making it more reasonable. Additionally, we present a novel multi-view
regulated supervision method for 3DGS that leverages information from
co-visible regions, further enhancing the distinctions between the transients
and statics. Then, we propose a straightforward yet effective multi-stage
training strategy to ensure robust training and high-quality view synthesis

a rasterization process on sparse voxels without neural networks or 3D
Gaussians. There are two key contributions coupled with the proposed system.
The first is to render sparse voxels in the correct depth order along pixel
rays by using dynamic Morton ordering. This avoids the well-known popping
artifact found in Gaussian splatting. Second, we adaptively fit sparse voxels
to different levels of detail within scenes, faithfully reproducing scene
details while achieving high rendering frame rates. Our method improves the
previous neural-free voxel grid representation by over 4db PSNR and more than
10x rendering FPS speedup, achieving state-of-the-art comparable novel-view

changes in their environment, particularly when observations are captured from
unconstrained and inconsistent viewpoints. We propose a novel label-free,
pose-agnostic change detection method that integrates information from multiple
viewpoints to construct a change-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)

our approach can learn additional change channels in a 3DGS and produce change
masks that outperform single-view techniques. Our change-aware 3D scene
representation additionally enables the generation of accurate change masks for
unseen viewpoints. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance in complex multi-object scenes, achieving a 1.7$\times$ and
1.6$\times$ improvement in Mean Intersection Over Union and F1 score
respectively over other baselines. We also contribute a new real-world dataset

multi-view image data into scene representations that allow view synthesis. In
particular, there is interest in enabling view synthesis for dynamic scenes
using only monocular input data -- an ill-posed and challenging problem. The
fast pace of work in this area has produced multiple simultaneous papers that
claim to work best, which cannot all be true. In this work, we organize,
benchmark, and analyze many Gaussian-splatting-based methods, providing
apples-to-apples comparisons that prior works have lacked. We use multiple
existing datasets and a new instructive synthetic dataset designed to isolate
factors that affect reconstruction quality. We systematically categorize
Gaussian splatting methods into specific motion representation types and
quantify how their differences impact performance. Empirically, we find that
their rank order is well-defined in synthetic data, but the complexity of
real-world data currently overwhelms the differences. Furthermore, the fast
rendering speed of all Gaussian-based methods comes at the cost of brittleness
in optimization. We summarize our experiments into a list of findings that can
help to further progress in this lively problem setting. Project Webpage:

multiview RGB videos, with a particular emphasis on recovering physically
accurate body and cloth movements. Our method, Position Based Dynamic Gaussians
(PBDyG), realizes ``movement-dependent'' cloth deformation via physical
simulation, rather than merely relying on ``pose-dependent'' rigid
transformations. We model the clothed human holistically but with two distinct
physical entities in contact: clothing modeled as 3D Gaussians, which are
attached to a skinned SMPL body that follows the movement of the person in the
input videos. The articulation of the SMPL body also drives physically-based
simulation of the clothes' Gaussians to transform the avatar to novel poses. In
order to run position based dynamics simulation, physical properties including
mass and material stiffness are estimated from the RGB videos through Dynamic
3D Gaussian Splatting. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only
accurately reproduces appearance but also enables the reconstruction of avatars

Mapping (SLAM) systems poses significant challenges due to dynamic scenes,
lighting variations, and seasonal changes, requiring robust solutions. While
traditional SLAM methods struggle with adaptability, deep learning-based
approaches and emerging neural radiance fields as well as Gaussian
Splatting-based SLAM methods, offer promising alternatives. However, these
methods have primarily been evaluated in controlled indoor environments with
stable conditions, leaving a gap in understanding their performance in
unstructured and variable outdoor settings. This study addresses this gap by
evaluating these methods in natural outdoor environments, focusing on camera
tracking accuracy, robustness to environmental factors, and computational
efficiency, highlighting distinct trade-offs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that neural SLAM methods achieve superior robustness, particularly under
challenging conditions such as low light, but at a high computational cost. At
the same time, traditional methods perform the best across seasons but are
highly sensitive to variations in lighting conditions. The code of the

method estimates RS compensated views and dense RS compensated disparity maps.
We present a two-stage method based on a 2D Gaussians Splatting that allows for
a ``render and compare"" strategy with a point cloud formulation. In the first
stage, a subset of sub-aperture images is used to estimate an RS agnostic 3D

second stage, the deformation of the 3D shape is computed by estimating an
admissible camera motion. We demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of
this approach through several experiments conducted for different scenes and
types of motions. Due to lack of suitable datasets for evaluation, we also

achieving high-fidelity rendering while reducing computational costs. Despite
the progress, optimizing dynamic neural fields from casual videos remains
challenging, as these videos do not provide direct 3D information, such as

RoDyGS, an optimization pipeline for dynamic Gaussian Splatting from casual

separating dynamic and static primitives, and ensures that the learned motion

their intrinsic geometric structures and spatiotemporal dynamics. Existing
methods that attempt to model dynamic urban scenes without leveraging priors on

We introduce Urban4D, a novel framework that employs a semantic-guided

intuitive and effective 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) representation that
aggregates temporal information through learnable time embeddings for each
Gaussian, predicting their deformations at desired timestamps using a
multilayer perceptron (MLP). For more accurate static reconstruction, we also
design a k-nearest neighbor (KNN)-based consistency regularization to handle

head avatars of a person on lifelong scale. Unlike current human head avatar
pipelines that capture identity at the momentary level(e.g., instant
photography or short videos), TimeWalker constructs a person's comprehensive
identity from unstructured data collection over his/her various life stages,
offering a paradigm to achieve full reconstruction and animation of that person
at different moments of life. At the heart of TimeWalker's success is a novel
neural parametric model that learns personalized representation with the
disentanglement of shape, expression, and appearance across ages. Central to
our methodology are the concepts of two aspects: (1) We track back to the
principle of modeling a person's identity in an additive combination of average
head representation in the canonical space, and moment-specific head attribute
representations driven from a set of neural head basis. To learn the set of
head basis that could represent the comprehensive head variations in a compact
manner, we propose a Dynamic Neural Basis-Blending Module (Dynamo). It
dynamically adjusts the number and blend weights of neural head bases,
according to both shared and specific traits of the target person over ages.
(2) Dynamic 2D Gaussian Splatting (DNA-2DGS), an extension of Gaussian
splatting representation, to model head motion deformations like facial
expressions without losing the realism of rendering and reconstruction.
DNA-2DGS includes a set of controllable 2D oriented planar Gaussian disks that
utilize the priors from parametric model, and move/rotate with the change of
expression. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we show TimeWalker's
ability to reconstruct and animate avatars across decoupled dimensions with
realistic rendering effects, demonstrating a way to achieve personalized 'time

crucial for robotic manipulation. However, existing approaches typically rely
on accurate depth information, which is non-trivial to obtain in real-world
scenarios. Although depth estimation algorithms can be employed, geometric
inaccuracy can lead to failures in RGBD-based pose tracking methods. To address
this challenge, we introduce GSGTrack, a novel RGB-based pose tracking
framework that jointly optimizes geometry and pose. Specifically, we adopt 3D
Gaussian Splatting to create an optimizable 3D representation, which is learned
simultaneously with a graph-based geometry optimization to capture the object's
appearance features and refine its geometry. However, the joint optimization
process is susceptible to perturbations from noisy pose and geometry data.
Thus, we propose an object silhouette loss to address the issue of pixel-wise
loss being overly sensitive to pose noise during tracking. To mitigate the
geometric ambiguities caused by inaccurate depth information, we propose a
geometry-consistent image pair selection strategy, which filters out
low-confidence pairs and ensures robust geometric optimization. Extensive

dense multi-view inputs, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios.
In this work, we propose SparseLGS to address the challenge of 3D scene

a learning-based dense stereo model to handle pose-free and sparse inputs, and
a three-step region matching approach to address the multi-view semantic
inconsistency problem, which is especially important for sparse inputs.
Different from directly learning high-dimensional CLIP features, we extract
low-dimensional information and build bijections to avoid excessive learning

to improve Gaussian positions and shapes. To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to address the 3D semantic field problem with sparse pose-free

based on 3DGS, specifically designed to represent and reconstruct highly
dynamic scenes. Our RelayGS learns a complete 4D representation with canonical
3D Gaussians and a compact motion field, consisting of three stages. First, we
learn a fundamental 3DGS from all frames, ignoring temporal scene variations,
and use a learnable mask to separate the highly dynamic foreground from the
minimally moving background. Second, we replicate multiple copies of the
decoupled foreground Gaussians from the first stage, each corresponding to a
temporal segment, and optimize them using pseudo-views constructed from
multiple frames within each segment. These Gaussians, termed Relay Gaussians,
act as explicit relay nodes, simplifying and breaking down large-scale motion
trajectories into smaller, manageable segments. Finally, we jointly learn the
scene's temporal motion and refine the canonical Gaussians learned from the
first two stages. We conduct thorough experiments on two dynamic scene datasets

representation that offers efficient, high-quality 3D reconstruction and
rendering. A major reason for the success of 3DGS is its simplicity of
representing a scene with a set of Gaussians, which makes it easy to interpret
and adapt. To enhance scene understanding beyond the visual representation,
approaches have been developed that extend 3D Gaussian Splatting with semantic
vision-language features, especially allowing for open-set tasks. In this
setting, the language features of 3D Gaussian Splatting are often aggregated
from multiple 2D views. Existing works address this aggregation problem using
cumbersome techniques that lead to high computational cost and training time.
  In this work, we show that the sophisticated techniques for language-grounded
3D Gaussian Splatting are simply unnecessary. Instead, we apply Occam's razor
to the task at hand and perform weighted multi-view feature aggregation using
the weights derived from the standard rendering process, followed by a simple

animatable human avatars from monocular videos,aiming at improving the novel
view and pose synthesis performance while ensuring fast training and real-time
rendering. Recently,3DGS has emerged as a more efficient and expressive
alternative to NeRF, and has been used for creating dynamic human avatars.
However,when applied to the severely ill-posed task of monocular dynamic
reconstruction, the Gaussians tend to overfit the constantly changing regions
such as clothes wrinkles or shadows since these regions cannot provide
consistent supervision, resulting in noisy geometry and abrupt deformation that
typically fail to generalize under novel views and poses.To address these
limitations, we present SAGA,i.e.,Surface-Aligned Gaussian Avatar,which aligns
the Gaussians with a mesh to enforce well-defined geometry and consistent
deformation, thereby improving generalization under novel views and poses.
Unlike existing strict alignment methods that suffer from limited expressive
power and low realism,SAGA employs a two-stage alignment strategy where the
Gaussians are first adhered on while then detached from the mesh, thus
facilitating both good geometry and high expressivity. In the Adhered Stage, we
improve the flexibility of Adhered-on-Mesh Gaussians by allowing them to flow
on the mesh, in contrast to existing methods that rigidly bind Gaussians to
fixed location. In the second Detached Stage, we introduce a Gaussian-Mesh
Alignment regularization, which allows us to unleash the expressivity by
detaching the Gaussians but maintain the geometric alignment by minimizing
their location and orientation offsets from the bound triangles. Finally, since
the Gaussians may drift outside the bound triangles during optimization, an

modeling 3D language fields for scene understanding and interaction has gained
growing interest. This paper introduces ChatSplat, a system that constructs a
3D language field, enabling rich chat-based interaction within 3D space. Unlike
existing methods that primarily use CLIP-derived language features focused
solely on segmentation, ChatSplat facilitates interaction on three levels:
objects, views, and the entire 3D scene. For view-level interaction, we
designed an encoder that encodes the rendered feature map of each view into
tokens, which are then processed by a large language model (LLM) for
conversation. At the scene level, ChatSplat combines multi-view tokens,
enabling interactions that consider the entire scene. For object-level
interaction, ChatSplat uses a patch-wise language embedding, unlike LangSplat's
pixel-wise language embedding that implicitly includes mask and embedding.
Here, we explicitly decouple the language embedding into separate mask and
feature map representations, allowing more flexible object-level interaction.
To address the challenge of learning 3D Gaussians posed by the complex and

Developing an effective and efficient algorithm that is capable of

methods leverage pre-trained 2D diffusion models for multi-view image
synthesis, which often leads to severe inconsistency between the generated

the octree built from the input 3D mesh to render the multiview images not only
for the albedo map but also for roughness and metallic. Moreover, our model is
trained in a regression manner instead of diffusion denoising, capable of
generating the PBR material for a 3D mesh in a single feed-forward process.

challenge of Distractor-free Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). It
accomplishes two key objectives: fortifying generalizable 3DGS against
distractor-laden data during both training and inference phases, while
successfully extending cross-scene adaptation capabilities to conventional
distractor-free approaches. To achieve these objectives, DGGS introduces a
scene-agnostic reference-based mask prediction and refinement methodology
during training phase, coupled with a training view selection strategy,
effectively improving distractor prediction accuracy and training stability.
Moreover, to address distractor-induced voids and artifacts during inference
stage, we propose a two-stage inference framework for better reference
selection based on the predicted distractor masks, complemented by a distractor
pruning module to eliminate residual distractor effects. Extensive
generalization experiments demonstrate DGGS's advantages under distractor-laden

static and dynamic objects, learning the Gaussians in either a supervised

neural implicit SDF (SDF-NeRF) techniques, trained using volumetric rendering,
have gained a lot of attention. Compared to earlier truncated SDF (TSDF) fusion
algorithms that rely on depth maps and voxelize continuous space, SDF-NeRF
enables continuous-space SDF reconstruction with better geometric and

are two-fold. First, we propose a new differentiable rendering method that
distorts 3D Gaussians using a series of affine transformations tailored to

splatting with fisheye cameras, which is hindered by light ray distortion
caused by lenses or mirrors. Besides, our method maintains real-time rendering

different camera models and regularizing the shared Gaussians with supervision
from different modalities, our framework learns a unified 3D Gaussian

precisely, we introduce (i) a new architecture to discretize and encode the

useful for the 4D evolution problem that we are concentrating on, is also novel
and valid for static scenes. Our extensive experiments on various data provide

Splatting (3DGS), have achieved high-quality novel view synthesis and fast
rendering by representing scenes with compositions of Gaussian primitives.
However, 3D Gaussians present several limitations for scene reconstruction.
Accurately capturing hard edges is challenging without significantly increasing
the number of Gaussians, creating a large memory footprint. Moreover, they
struggle to represent flat surfaces, as they are diffused in space. Without
hand-crafted regularizers, they tend to disperse irregularly around the actual
surface. To circumvent these issues, we introduce a novel method, named 3D
Convex Splatting (3DCS), which leverages 3D smooth convexes as primitives for
modeling geometrically-meaningful radiance fields from multi-view images.
Smooth convex shapes offer greater flexibility than Gaussians, allowing for a
better representation of 3D scenes with hard edges and dense volumes using
fewer primitives. Powered by our efficient CUDA-based rasterizer, 3DCS achieves
superior performance over 3DGS on benchmarks such as Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and

To accommodate varying lighting conditions, existing 3DGS extensions apply
color mapping to the massive Gaussian primitives with individually optimized

massive color mapping and pixel-wise uncertainty prediction strategies suffer
from not only additional computational costs but also coarse-grained lighting

leverages a novel light decoupling strategy where appearance embeddings are
optimized based on nexus kernels instead of massive Gaussian primitives, thus
accelerating reconstruction speeds while ensuring local color consistency for
finer textures. Additionally, a Gaussian-wise uncertainty mechanism is
developed, aligning 3D structures with 2D image features for fine-grained

input. Despite utilizing advanced pose estimators like COLMAP or ARKit, camera
poses can still be noisy. Existing pose-NeRF joint optimization methods handle
poses with small noise (inliers) effectively but struggle with large noise
(outliers), such as mirrored poses. In this work, we focus on mitigating the
impact of outlier poses. Our method integrates an inlier-outlier confidence
estimation scheme, leveraging scene graph information gathered during the data
preparation phase. Unlike previous works directly using rendering metrics as
the reference, we employ a detached color network that omits the viewing
direction as input to minimize the impact caused by shape-radiance ambiguities.
This enhanced confidence updating strategy effectively differentiates between
inlier and outlier poses, allowing us to sample more rays from inlier poses to
construct more reliable radiance fields. Additionally, we introduce a
re-projection loss based on the current Signed Distance Function (SDF) and pose
estimations, strengthening the constraints between matching image pairs. For
outlier poses, we adopt a Monte Carlo re-localization method to find better
solutions. We also devise a scene graph updating strategy to provide more

of a scene given the images from a few viewpoints. This is a fundamental
problem in computer vision and graphics, and enables a vast variety of
applications such as meta-verse, free-view watching of events, video gaming,
video stabilization and video compression. Recent 3D representations such as
radiance fields and multi-plane images significantly improve the quality of
images rendered from novel viewpoints. However, these models require a dense
sampling of input views for high quality renders. Their performance goes down
significantly when only a few input views are available. In this thesis, we
focus on the sparse input novel view synthesis problem for both static and
dynamic scenes. In the first part of this work, we mainly focus on sparse input
novel view synthesis of static scenes using neural radiance fields (NeRF). We
study the design of reliable and dense priors to better regularize the NeRF in
such situations. In particular, we propose a prior on the visibility of the
pixels in a pair of input views. We show that this visibility prior, which is
related to the relative depth of objects, is dense and more reliable than
existing priors on absolute depth. We compute the visibility prior using plane
sweep volumes without the need to train a neural network on large datasets. We
evaluate our approach on multiple datasets and show that our model outperforms
existing approaches for sparse input novel view synthesis. In the second part,
we aim to further improve the regularization by learning a scene-specific prior
that does not suffer from generalization issues. We achieve this by learning
the prior on the given scene alone without pre-training on large datasets. In
particular, we design augmented NeRFs to obtain better depth supervision in
certain regions of the scene for the main NeRF. Further, we extend this
framework to also apply to newer and faster radiance field models such as
TensoRF and ZipNeRF. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
show the superiority of our approach in sparse input novel view synthesis. The
design of sparse input fast dynamic radiance fields is severely constrained by
the lack of suitable representations and reliable priors for motion. We address
the first challenge by designing an explicit motion model based on factorized
volumes that is compact and optimizes quickly. We also introduce reliable
sparse flow priors to constrain the motion field, since we find that the
popularly employed dense optical flow priors are unreliable. We show the
benefits of our motion representation and reliable priors on multiple datasets.
In the final part of this thesis, we study the application of view synthesis
for frame rate upsampling in video gaming. Specifically, we consider the
problem of temporal view synthesis, where the goal is to predict the future
frames given the past frames and the camera motion. The key challenge here is
in predicting the future motion of the objects by estimating their past motion
and extrapolating it. We explore the use of multi-plane image representations
and scene depth to reliably estimate the object motion, particularly in the
occluded regions. We design a new database to effectively evaluate our approach
for temporal view synthesis of dynamic scenes and show that we achieve

network effectively control the ratio of unoccupied and occupied points,
motivated by the prior that most of 3D scene points are unoccupied. Second, we
design an imbalanced architecture containing a large scene network and a small

model the imbalanced nature of occupied and unoccupied regions. Third, we
design an explicit density loss to guide the occupancy network, making the

of scenes represented as 3D Gaussians. Our approach allows for selecting the
objects to be segmented by interacting with a single view. It accepts intuitive

Splatting (3DGS) as the underlying scene representation simplifies the
extraction of objects of interest which are considered to be a subset of the
scene's Gaussians. Our key idea is to represent the scene as a graph and use
the graph-cut algorithm to minimize an energy function to effectively partition
the Gaussians into foreground and background. To achieve this, we construct a
graph based on scene Gaussians and devise a segmentation-aligned energy
function on the graph to combine user inputs with scene properties. To obtain
an initial coarse segmentation, we leverage 2D image/video segmentation models
and further refine these coarse estimates using our graph construction. Our

constrained optimization and machine learning methods with varying success,
less so for ultra-sparse view CT reconstruction with one to two views. Neural
radiance field (NeRF) is a powerful tool for reconstructing and rendering 3D
natural scenes from sparse views, but its direct application to 3D medical

producing novel-view images from high-quality scene images. However, hand-held
low-light photography challenges NeRFs as the captured images may
simultaneously suffer from low visibility, noise, and camera shakes. While
existing NeRF methods may handle either low light or motion, directly combining
them or incorporating additional image-based enhancement methods does not work
as these degradation factors are highly coupled. We observe that noise in
low-light images is always sharp regardless of camera shakes, which implies an
implicit order of these degradation factors within the image formation process.
To this end, we propose in this paper a novel model, named LuSh-NeRF, which can
reconstruct a clean and sharp NeRF from a group of hand-held low-light images.
The key idea of LuSh-NeRF is to sequentially model noise and blur in the images
via multi-view feature consistency and frequency information of NeRF,
respectively. Specifically, LuSh-NeRF includes a novel Scene-Noise

challenges for storage and transmission, making 3D GS compression an essential
technology. Current 3D GS compression research primarily focuses on developing
more compact scene representations, such as converting explicit 3D GS data into
implicit forms. In contrast, compression of the GS data itself has hardly been
explored. To address this gap, we propose a Hierarchical GS Compression (HGSC)
technique. Initially, we prune unimportant Gaussians based on importance scores
derived from both global and local significance, effectively reducing
redundancy while maintaining visual quality. An Octree structure is used to
compress 3D positions. Based on the 3D GS Octree, we implement a hierarchical
attribute compression strategy by employing a KD-tree to partition the 3D GS
into multiple blocks. We apply farthest point sampling to select anchor
primitives within each block and others as non-anchor primitives with varying
Levels of Details (LoDs). Anchor primitives serve as reference points for
predicting non-anchor primitives across different LoDs to reduce spatial
redundancy. For anchor primitives, we use the region adaptive hierarchical
transform to achieve near-lossless compression of various attributes. For
non-anchor primitives, each is predicted based on the k-nearest anchor
primitives. To further minimize prediction errors, the reconstructed LoD and
anchor primitives are combined to form new anchor primitives to predict the
next LoD. Our method notably achieves superior compression quality and a
significant data size reduction of over 4.5 times compared to the

detecting physical object rearrangements in 3D scenes. Our approach estimates
3D object-level changes by comparing two sets of unaligned images taken at
different times. Leveraging 3DGS's novel view rendering and EfficientSAM's
zero-shot segmentation capabilities, we detect 2D object-level changes, which
are then associated and fused across views to estimate 3D changes. Our method
can detect changes in cluttered environments using sparse post-change images
within as little as 18s, using as few as a single new image. It does not rely
on depth input, user instructions, object classes, or object models -- An
object is recognized simply if it has been re-arranged. Our approach is
evaluated on both public and self-collected real-world datasets, achieving up
to 14% higher accuracy and three orders of magnitude faster performance
compared to the state-of-the-art radiance-field-based change detection method.
This significant performance boost enables a broad range of downstream

of novel objects, named GS2Pose. By introducing 3D Gaussian splatting, GS2Pose
can utilize the reconstruction results without requiring a high-quality CAD
model, which means it only requires segmented RGBD images as input.
Specifically, GS2Pose employs a two-stage structure consisting of coarse
estimation followed by refined estimation. In the coarse stage, a lightweight
U-Net network with a polarization attention mechanism, called Pose-Net, is
designed. By using the 3DGS model for supervised training, Pose-Net can
generate NOCS images to compute a coarse pose. In the refinement stage, GS2Pose
formulates a pose regression algorithm following the idea of reprojection or
Bundle Adjustment (BA), referred to as GS-Refiner. By leveraging Lie algebra to
extend 3DGS, GS-Refiner obtains a pose-differentiable rendering pipeline that
refines the coarse pose by comparing the input images with the rendered images.
GS-Refiner also selectively updates parameters in the 3DGS model to achieve
environmental adaptation, thereby enhancing the algorithm's robustness and
flexibility to illuminative variation, occlusion, and other challenging
disruptive factors. GS2Pose was evaluated through experiments conducted on the
LineMod dataset, where it was compared with similar algorithms, yielding highly

perception consisting of associating each LiDAR point to a semantic label.
Fully-supervised models have widely tackled this task, but they require labels
for each scan, which either limits their domain or requires impractical amounts
of expensive annotations. Camera images, which are generally recorded alongside
LiDAR pointclouds, can be processed by the widely available 2D foundation
models, which are generic and dataset-agnostic. However, distilling knowledge
from 2D data to improve LiDAR perception raises domain adaptation challenges.
For example, the classical perspective projection suffers from the parallax
effect produced by the position shift between both sensors at their respective
capture times. We propose a Semi-Supervised Learning setup to leverage
unlabeled LiDAR pointclouds alongside distilled knowledge from the camera
images. To self-supervise our model on the unlabeled scans, we add an auxiliary
NeRF head and cast rays from the camera viewpoint over the unlabeled voxel
features. The NeRF head predicts densities and semantic logits at each sampled
ray location which are used for rendering pixel semantics. Concurrently, we
query the Segment-Anything (SAM) foundation model with the camera image to
generate a set of unlabeled generic masks. We fuse the masks with the rendered
pixel semantics from LiDAR to produce pseudo-labels that supervise the pixel
predictions. During inference, we drop the NeRF head and run our model with
only LiDAR. We show the effectiveness of our approach in three public LiDAR

Reconstructing NeRF from few-view images without poses is challenging and
highly ill-posed. To address this problem, we propose CAD-NeRF, a method
reconstructed from less than 10 images without any known poses. Specifically,
we build a mini library of several CAD models from ShapeNet and render them
from many random views. Given sparse-view input images, we run a model and pose
retrieval from the library, to get a model with similar shapes, serving as the
density supervision and pose initializations. Here we propose a multi-view pose
retrieval method to avoid pose conflicts among views, which is a new and unseen
problem in uncalibrated NeRF methods. Then, the geometry of the object is
trained by the CAD guidance. The deformation of the density field and camera
poses are optimized jointly. Then texture and density are trained and

Applying a traditional NeRF training routine can result in the network learning
phantom surfaces in free space between conflicting range measurements, similar
to how floater aberrations may be produced by an image model. We show that by
formulating loss as an integral of probability (rather than as an integral of
optical density) the network can learn multiple peaks for a given ray, allowing
the sampling of first, nth, or strongest returns from a single output channel.

techniques devised thus far predominantly focus on learning individual scene
representations. In contrast, learning large sets of scenes has been a
considerable bottleneck in NeRF developments, as repeatedly applying inverse
graphics on a sequence of scenes, though essential for various applications,
remains largely prohibitive in terms of resource costs. We introduce a
framework termed ""scaled inverse graphics"", aimed at efficiently learning large
sets of scene representations, and propose a novel method to this end. It
operates in two stages: (i) training a compression model on a subset of scenes,
then (ii) training NeRF models on the resulting smaller representations,
thereby reducing the optimization space per new scene. In practice, we compact
the representation of scenes by learning NeRFs in a latent space to reduce the
image resolution, and sharing information across scenes to reduce NeRF
representation complexity. We experimentally show that our method presents both
the lowest training time and memory footprint in scaled inverse graphics

novel view synthesis (NVS). However, the 3DGS model tends to overfit when
trained with sparse posed views, limiting its generalization capacity for
broader pose variations. In this paper, we alleviate the overfitting problem by
introducing a self-ensembling Gaussian Splatting (SE-GS) approach. We present
two Gaussian Splatting models named the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model and the
$\mathbf{\Delta}$-model. The $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model serves as the primary
model that generates novel-view images during inference. At the training stage,
the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model is guided away from specific local optima by an
uncertainty-aware perturbing strategy. We dynamically perturb the
$\mathbf{\Delta}$-model based on the uncertainties of novel-view renderings
across different training steps, resulting in diverse temporal models sampled
from the Gaussian parameter space without additional training costs. The
geometry of the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model is regularized by penalizing
discrepancies between the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model and the temporal samples.
Therefore, our SE-GS conducts an effective and efficient regularization across
a large number of Gaussian Splatting models, resulting in a robust ensemble,
the $\mathbf{\Sigma}$-model. Experimental results on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF360,
DTU, and MVImgNet datasets show that our approach improves NVS quality with
few-shot training views, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. The

scenes parameterized by 3D Gaussians from \textit{unposed} sparse multi-view
images. Our model, trained exclusively with photometric loss, achieves
real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction during inference. To eliminate the need
for accurate pose input during reconstruction, we anchor one input view's local
camera coordinates as the canonical space and train the network to predict
Gaussian primitives for all views within this space. This approach obviates the
need to transform Gaussian primitives from local coordinates into a global
coordinate system, thus avoiding errors associated with per-frame Gaussians and
pose estimation. To resolve scale ambiguity, we design and compare various
intrinsic embedding methods, ultimately opting to convert camera intrinsics
into a token embedding and concatenate it with image tokens as input to the
model, enabling accurate scene scale prediction. We utilize the reconstructed
3D Gaussians for novel view synthesis and pose estimation tasks and propose a
two-stage coarse-to-fine pipeline for accurate pose estimation. Experimental
results demonstrate that our pose-free approach can achieve superior novel view
synthesis quality compared to pose-required methods, particularly in scenarios

Specifically, we construct a Neural Water Field (NWF) to implicitly model the

physics-based underwater image formation model to represent complex underwater

design a Depth-Guided Optimization (DGO) mechanism that uses a pseudo-depth map

novel underwater viewpoints and supports restoring the true appearance of
underwater scenes, as if the water medium were absent. Extensive experiments on

resort to approximating surface normals, but often struggle with noisy local

together, where we first extract isosurface mesh from a scalar field, then
convert it into 3DGS points and formulate PBR equations for them in a fully

enabling precise surface normal modeling, which facilitates the use of PBR

field of static scene rendering. Due to the low computational overhead and
inherent flexibility of explicit representations, plane-based explicit methods
are popular ways to predict deformations for Gaussian-based dynamic scene
rendering models. However, plane-based methods rely on the inappropriate
low-rank assumption and excessively decompose the space-time 4D encoding,
resulting in overmuch feature overlap and unsatisfactory rendering quality. To
tackle these problems, we propose Grid4D, a dynamic scene rendering model based
on Gaussian splatting and employing a novel explicit encoding method for the 4D
input through the hash encoding. Different from plane-based explicit
representations, we decompose the 4D encoding into one spatial and three
temporal 3D hash encodings without the low-rank assumption. Additionally, we
design a novel attention module that generates the attention scores in a
directional range to aggregate the spatial and temporal features. The
directional attention enables Grid4D to more accurately fit the diverse
deformations across distinct scene components based on the spatial encoded
features. Moreover, to mitigate the inherent lack of smoothness in explicit
representation methods, we introduce a smooth regularization term that keeps
our model from the chaos of deformation prediction. Our experiments demonstrate
that Grid4D significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in visual

high-fidelity novel view synthesis at real-time speeds. However, the noisy and
discrete nature of 3D Gaussian primitives hinders accurate surface estimation.
Previous attempts to regularize 3D Gaussian normals often degrade rendering

we employ an anchor-based 3DGS to implicitly encode locally-shared IDIVs.
Additionally, Normal-GS leverages optimized normals and Integrated Directional

Our method addresses this limitation by introducing a residual correction

robotic applications often face challenges such as motion blur, insufficient

downstream tasks like navigation, inspection, and scene visualization. To
address these challenges, we propose E-3DGS, a novel event-based approach that
partitions events into motion (from camera or object movement) and exposure

the latter to reconstruct grayscale images for high-quality training and

rendering times to account for dynamic motions. In this paper, we design a
Explicit 4D Gaussian Splatting(Ex4DGS). Our key idea is to firstly separate
static and dynamic Gaussians during training, and to explicitly sample
positions and rotations of the dynamic Gaussians at sparse timestamps. The
sampled positions and rotations are then interpolated to represent both
spatially and temporally continuous motions of objects in dynamic scenes as
well as reducing computational cost. Additionally, we introduce a progressive

extend timestamps, which makes it work well with a few point clouds. The
point-backtracking is used to quantify the cumulative error of each Gaussian

biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high
temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind
inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid
scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and
propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly
integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key
components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events

Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise

Consequently, these methods face limitations when rendering complex maneuvers

autonomous-driving world models have demonstrated the potential to generate
diverse driving videos. However, these approaches remain constrained to 2D

capture intricacies of dynamic driving environments. In this paper, we
introduce DriveDreamer4D, which enhances 4D driving scene representation

spatial-temporal consistency of foreground and background elements, thus the
generated data adheres closely to traffic constraints. To our knowledge,
DriveDreamer4D is the first to utilize video generation models for improving 4D

DriveDreamer4D significantly enhances generation quality under novel trajectory

for capturing complex dynamic 3D scenes with high fidelity. It utilizes a 4D
Gaussian representation and a GPU-friendly rasterizer, enabling rapid rendering
speeds. Despite its advantages, 4DGS faces significant challenges, notably the
requirement of millions of 4D Gaussians, each with extensive associated
attributes, leading to substantial memory and storage cost. This paper
introduces a memory-efficient framework for 4DGS. We streamline the color
attribute by decomposing it into a per-Gaussian direct color component with
only 3 parameters and a shared lightweight alternating current color predictor.
This approach eliminates the need for spherical harmonics coefficients, which
typically involve up to 144 parameters in classic 4DGS, thereby creating a
memory-efficient 4D Gaussian representation. Furthermore, we introduce an
entropy-constrained Gaussian deformation technique that uses a deformation
field to expand the action range of each Gaussian and integrates an
opacity-based entropy loss to limit the number of Gaussians, thus forcing our
model to use as few Gaussians as possible to fit a dynamic scene well. With
simple half-precision storage and zip compression, our framework achieves a
storage reduction by approximately 190$\times$ and 125$\times$ on the

3D models ensure consistency across different views but often result in overly
smooth textures. We propose bridging the gap between 2D and 3D diffusion models
to address this limitation by integrating a two-stage frequency-based

methods suffer from the following problems: 1) Inevitable information dropping
during 3D reconstruction; 2) Tight coupling between specific hardware and
algorithm for 3D reconstruction. It leads us to a question: Is it indispensable
to reconstruct 3D information explicitly in recognition tasks? Hence, we
consider this problem in an implicit manner, leaving the nerve-wracking 3D
reconstruction problem for learnable neural networks with the help of neural
radiance fields (NeRFs). We propose FingerNeRF, a novel generalizable NeRF for
3D finger biometrics. To handle the shape-radiance ambiguity problem that may
result in incorrect 3D geometry, we aim to involve extra geometric priors based
on the correspondence of binary finger traits like fingerprints or finger
veins. First, we propose a novel Trait Guided Transformer (TGT) module to
enhance the feature correspondence with the guidance of finger traits. Second,
we involve extra geometric constraints on the volume rendering loss with the

We consider the distance between each Gaussian splat and the mesh surface to
distinguish between tightly-bound and loosely-bound Gaussian splats. The
tightly-bound splats are flattened and aligned well with the mesh geometry. The
loosely-bound Gaussian splats are used to account for the artifacts in
reconstructed 3D meshes in terms of rendering. We present a training strategy

coherence, including popping artifacts due to inconsistent transparency sorting
and perspective-correct outlines of (2D) splats. At the same time, real-time
requirements forced such implementations to accept compromises in how
transparency of large assemblies of 3D Gaussians is resolved, in turn breaking
coherence in other ways. In our work, we aim at achieving maximum coherence, by
rendering fully perspective-correct 3D Gaussians while using a high-quality

thereby ensuring numerical stability and eliminating the need for special
handling of degenerate splats, and the hybrid transparency formulation for
blending maintains similar quality as fully resolved per-pixel transparencies

Current 3D generation methods utilizing NeRF or 3D-GS as representations for 3D

Our approach begins with introducing a large-scale synthetic car dataset
comprising over 1,000 high-precision 3D vehicle models. We represent 3D objects
using global illumination and relightable 3D Gaussian primitives integrating
with BRDF parameters. Building on this representation, we introduce a

insights into this problem. Although subsequent efforts rapidly extend static
3D Gaussian to dynamic scenes, they often lack explicit constraints on object
motion, leading to optimization difficulties and performance degradation. To
address the above issues, we propose a novel deformable 3D Gaussian splatting
framework called MotionGS, which explores explicit motion priors to guide the
deformation of 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we first introduce an optical flow
decoupling module that decouples optical flow into camera flow and motion flow,
corresponding to camera movement and object motion respectively. Then the
motion flow can effectively constrain the deformation of 3D Gaussians, thus
simulating the motion of dynamic objects. Additionally, a camera pose
refinement module is proposed to alternately optimize 3D Gaussians and camera
poses, mitigating the impact of inaccurate camera poses. Extensive experiments

the perceptual identity similarity of the synthesized result (from the

solve this problem by learning an individual neural radiance field (NeRF) for
each identity to implicitly store its static and dynamic information, we find
it inefficient and non-generalized due to the per-identity-per-training

first attempt that exploits the rich knowledge from a NeRF-based

generation of dynamic 3D objects from monocular videos. Previous methods mainly
rely on the implicit neural radiance fields (NeRF) or explicit Gaussian
Splatting as the underlying representation, and struggle to achieve

inspiration from modern 3D animation pipelines, we introduce DreamMesh4D, a
novel framework combining mesh representation with geometric skinning technique
to generate high-quality 4D object from a monocular video. Instead of utilizing
classical texture map for appearance, we bind Gaussian splats to triangle face
of mesh for differentiable optimization of both the texture and mesh vertices.
In particular, DreamMesh4D begins with a coarse mesh obtained through an
image-to-3D generation procedure. Sparse points are then uniformly sampled
across the mesh surface, and are used to build a deformation graph to drive the
motion of the 3D object for the sake of computational efficiency and providing
additional constraint. For each step, transformations of sparse control points
are predicted using a deformation network, and the mesh vertices as well as the
surface Gaussians are deformed via a novel geometric skinning algorithm, which
is a hybrid approach combining LBS (linear blending skinning) and DQS
(dual-quaternion skinning), mitigating drawbacks associated with both
approaches. The static surface Gaussians and mesh vertices as well as the
deformation network are learned via reference view photometric loss, score
distillation loss as well as other regularizers in a two-stage manner.

leading to point clouds with excessive canopy noise and incorrectly
reconstructed trees, such as duplicated trunks. NeRF, while better for canopy
regions, may produce errors in ground areas with limited views. The 3DGS method
generates sparser point clouds, particularly in trunk areas, affecting diameter

However, in real-world, online robotic scenes where the number of views is
limited given efficiency requirements, random view selection for 3DGS becomes
impractical as views are often overlapping and redundant. We address this issue
by proposing an end-to-end online training and active view selection pipeline,

primary challenges: firstly, the time-consuming and computationally demanding
tetrahedralization process; and secondly, handling complex or thin structures
often leads to either excessive, storage-intensive tetrahedral meshes or
poor-quality ones that impair deformation capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose DeformRF, a method that seamlessly integrates the
manipulability of tetrahedral meshes with the high-quality rendering
capabilities of feature grid representations. To avoid ill-shaped tetrahedra
and tetrahedralization for each object, we propose a two-stage training
strategy. Starting with an almost-regular tetrahedral grid, our model initially
retains key tetrahedra surrounding the object and subsequently refines object
details using finer-granularity mesh in the second stage. We also present the
concept of recursively subdivided tetrahedra to create higher-resolution meshes
implicitly. This enables multi-resolution encoding while only necessitating the
storage of the coarse tetrahedral mesh generated in the first training stage.
We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our DeformRF on both synthetic and

novel view synthesis, facilitating real-time, high-quality image rendering.
However, in scenarios involving reflective surfaces, particularly mirrors,
3D-GS often misinterprets reflections as virtual spaces, resulting in blurred
and inconsistent multi-view rendering within mirrors. Our paper presents a
novel method aimed at obtaining high-quality multi-view consistent reflection
rendering by modelling reflections as physically-based virtual cameras. We
estimate mirror planes with depth and normal estimates from 3D-GS and define
virtual cameras that are placed symmetrically about the mirror plane. These
virtual cameras are then used to explain mirror reflections in the scene. To
address imperfections in mirror plane estimates, we propose a straightforward
yet effective virtual camera optimization method to enhance reflection quality.
We collect a new mirror dataset including three real-world scenarios for more

have been adapted for 3D Object Detection (3DOD), offering a promising approach
to 3DOD through view-synthesis representation. However, NeRF faces inherent
limitations: (i) limited representational capacity for 3DOD due to its implicit
nature, and (ii) slow rendering speeds. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
has emerged as an explicit 3D representation that addresses these limitations.
Inspired by these advantages, this paper introduces 3DGS into 3DOD for the
first time, identifying two main challenges: (i) Ambiguous spatial distribution
of Gaussian blobs: 3DGS primarily relies on 2D pixel-level supervision,
resulting in unclear 3D spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs and poor
differentiation between objects and background, which hinders 3DOD; (ii)
Excessive background blobs: 2D images often include numerous background pixels,
leading to densely reconstructed 3DGS with many noisy Gaussian blobs
representing the background, negatively affecting detection. To tackle the
challenge (i), we leverage the fact that 3DGS reconstruction is derived from 2D
images, and propose an elegant and efficient solution by incorporating 2D
Boundary Guidance to significantly enhance the spatial distribution of Gaussian
blobs, resulting in clearer differentiation between objects and their
background. To address the challenge (ii), we propose a Box-Focused Sampling
strategy using 2D boxes to generate object probability distribution in 3D
spaces, allowing effective probabilistic sampling in 3D to retain more object
blobs and reduce noisy background blobs. Benefiting from our designs, our
3DGS-DET significantly outperforms the SOTA NeRF-based method, NeRF-Det,

exceptional capability in real-time human novel view synthesis. However,
existing approaches are restricted to dense viewpoint settings, which limits
their flexibility in free-viewpoint rendering across a wide range of camera
view angle discrepancies. To address this limitation, we propose a real-time
pipeline named EVA-Gaussian for 3D human novel view synthesis across diverse
camera settings. Specifically, we first introduce an Efficient cross-View
Attention (EVA) module to accurately estimate the position of each 3D Gaussian
from the source images. Then, we integrate the source images with the estimated
Gaussian position map to predict the attributes and feature embeddings of the
3D Gaussians. Moreover, we employ a recurrent feature refiner to correct
artifacts caused by geometric errors in position estimation and enhance visual
fidelity.To further improve synthesis quality, we incorporate a powerful anchor
loss function for both 3D Gaussian attributes and human face landmarks.

The construction of radiance fields on-the-fly in G-NeRF simplifies the NVS

the proposed texture preserving transformer (TP-Former) aggregates multi-view

However, current Gaussian Splatting SLAM methods, designed mainly for hand-held

achieve accurate localization and photorealistic rendering performance. The
carefully designed Gaussian Splatting Loop Closure module effectively addresses
the issue of accumulated tracking and mapping errors found in conventional

anchor frame and categorized as historical or novel based on its timestamp. By
rendering different types of Gaussians at the same viewpoint, the proposed loop
detection strategy considers both co-visibility relationships and distinct

proposed to remove camera pose drift and maintain the high quality of 3D

algorithm to correct pose drift and updates Gaussians based on the optimized

increasingly highlighted the robustness of LiDAR-based techniques. At the same
time, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have introduced new possibilities for 3D
scene reconstruction, exemplified by SLAM systems. Among these, NeRF-LOAM has
shown notable performance in NeRF-based SLAM applications. However, despite its
strengths, these systems often encounter difficulties in dynamic outdoor
environments due to their inherent static assumptions. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes a novel method designed to improve
reconstruction in highly dynamic outdoor scenes. Based on NeRF-LOAM, the
proposed approach consists of two primary components. First, we separate the
scene into static background and dynamic foreground. By identifying and
excluding dynamic elements from the mapping process, this segmentation enables
the creation of a dense 3D map that accurately represents the static background
only. The second component extends the octree structure to support
multi-resolution representation. This extension not only enhances
reconstruction quality but also aids in the removal of dynamic objects
identified by the first module. Additionally, Fourier feature encoding is
applied to the sampled points, capturing high-frequency information and leading
to more complete reconstruction results. Evaluations on various datasets

particularly ideal for operating under high-speed, high dynamic range and
low-light conditions, where standard cameras underperform. Nonetheless, event
cameras still suffer from some amount of motion blur, especially under these
challenging conditions, in contrary to what most think. This is attributed to
the limited bandwidth of the event sensor pixel, which is mostly proportional
to the light intensity. Thus, to ensure that event cameras can truly excel in
such conditions where it has an edge over standard cameras, it is crucial to
account for event motion blur in downstream applications, especially
reconstruction. However, none of the recent works on reconstructing Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) from events, nor event simulators, have considered the
full effects of event motion blur. To this end, we propose, Deblur e-NeRF, a
novel method to directly and effectively reconstruct blur-minimal NeRFs from
motion-blurred events generated under high-speed motion or low-light
conditions. The core component of this work is a physically-accurate pixel
bandwidth model proposed to account for event motion blur under arbitrary speed

preventing them from broader utility on resource-constrained devices. We
introduce LightAvatar, the first head avatar model based on neural light fields

we introduce dedicated network designs to obtain proper representations for the

Wasserstein-2 distance, we ensure that the transformation maintains spatial

smaller chunks to enhance efficiency. This paradigm shift reframes stylization
from a pure generative process driven by latent space losses to an explicit

approaches that leverage unstructured Gaussians to model human avatars, our
method reconstructs the hair using 3D polylines, or strands. This fundamental
difference allows the use of the resulting hairstyles out-of-the-box in modern
computer graphics engines for editing, rendering, and simulation. Our 3D
lifting method relies on unstructured Gaussians to generate multi-view ground
truth data to supervise the fitting of hair strands. The hairstyle itself is
represented in the form of the so-called strand-aligned 3D Gaussians. This
representation allows us to combine strand-based hair priors, which are
essential for realistic modeling of the inner structure of hairstyles, with the

few-shot Novel View Synthesis (NVS), which is a significant challenge in 3D
vision applications. Despite numerous attempts to reduce the dense input
requirement in NeRF, it still suffers from time-consumed training and rendering
processes. More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time
high-quality rendering with an explicit point-based representation. However,
similar to NeRF, it tends to overfit the train views for lack of constraints.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{MVPGS}, a few-shot NVS method that excavates
the multi-view priors based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. We leverage the recent
learning-based Multi-view Stereo (MVS) to enhance the quality of geometric
initialization for 3DGS. To mitigate overfitting, we propose a forward-warping
method for additional appearance constraints conforming to scenes based on the
computed geometry. Furthermore, we introduce a view-consistent geometry
constraint for Gaussian parameters to facilitate proper optimization
convergence and utilize a monocular depth regularization as compensation.

we propose MOSE, a neural field semantic reconstruction approach to lift
inferred image-level noisy priors to 3D, producing accurate semantics and
geometry in both 3D and 2D space. The key motivation for our method is to
leverage generic class-agnostic segment masks as guidance to promote local

we further apply a smoothness regularization to texture-less regions for better

efficient visual localization method capable of high-quality rendering with
fewer parameters. Specifically, our approach leverages 3D Gaussian primitives
as the scene representation. To ensure precise 2D-3D correspondences for pose
estimation, we develop an unbiased 3D scene-specific descriptor decoder for
Gaussian primitives, distilled from a constructed feature volume. Additionally,
we introduce a salient 3D landmark selection algorithm that selects a suitable
primitive subset based on the saliency score for localization. We further
regularize key Gaussian primitives to prevent anisotropic effects, which also
improves localization performance. Extensive experiments on two widely used

event streams, instead of fixed frames. Benefiting from their distinct
advantages, such as high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, event
cameras have been applied to address 3D reconstruction, important for robotic
mapping. Recently, neural rendering techniques, such as 3D Gaussian splatting
(3DGS), have been shown successful in 3D reconstruction. However, it still
remains under-explored how to develop an effective event-based 3DGS pipeline.
In particular, as 3DGS typically depends on high-quality initialization and
dense multiview constraints, a potential problem appears for the 3DGS
optimization with events given its inherent sparse property. To this end, we
propose a novel event-based 3DGS framework, named Elite-EvGS. Our key idea is
to distill the prior knowledge from the off-the-shelf event-to-video (E2V)
models to effectively reconstruct 3D scenes from events in a coarse-to-fine
optimization manner. Specifically, to address the complexity of 3DGS
initialization from events, we introduce a novel warm-up initialization
strategy that optimizes a coarse 3DGS from the frames generated by E2V models
and then incorporates events to refine the details. Then, we propose a
progressive event supervision strategy that employs the window-slicing
operation to progressively reduce the number of events used for supervision.
This subtly relives the temporal randomness of the event frames, benefiting the
optimization of local textural and global structural details. Experiments on
the benchmark datasets demonstrate that Elite-EvGS can reconstruct 3D scenes

easily exhibits needle-like artifacts, especially when increasing the sampling
rate. Mip-Splatting tries to remove these artifacts with a 3D smoothing filter
for frequency constraints and a 2D Mip filter for approximated supersampling.
Unfortunately, it tends to produce over-blurred results, and sometimes
needle-like Gaussians still persist. Our spectral analysis of the covariance
matrix during optimization and densification reveals that current 3D-GS lacks
shape awareness, relying instead on spectral radius and view positional
gradients to determine splitting. As a result, needle-like Gaussians with small
positional gradients and low spectral entropy fail to split and overfit
high-frequency details. Furthermore, both the filters used in 3D-GS and
Mip-Splatting reduce the spectral entropy and increase the condition number

more pronounced artifacts. Our Spectral-GS, based on spectral analysis,

GStex, yields improved visual quality over prior work in texturing Gaussian

are extremely useful primitives in computer vision. 3D edges comprise of lines
and curves, and methods to reconstruct them use either multi-view images or
point clouds as input. State-of-the-art image-based methods first learn a 3D
edge point cloud then fit 3D edges to it. The edge point cloud is obtained by
learning a 3D neural implicit edge field from which the 3D edge points are
sampled on a specific level set (0 or 1). However, such methods present two
important drawbacks: i) it is not realistic to sample points on exact level
sets due to float imprecision and training inaccuracies. Instead, they are
sampled within a range of levels so the points do not lie accurately on the 3D
edges and require further processing. ii) Such implicit representations are
computationally expensive and require long training times. In this paper, we
address these two limitations and propose a 3D edge mapping that is simpler,
more efficient, and preserves accuracy. Our method learns explicitly the 3D
edge points and their edge direction hence bypassing the need for point
sampling. It casts a 3D edge point as the center of a 3D Gaussian and the edge
direction as the principal axis of the Gaussian. Such a representation has the
advantage of being not only geometrically meaningful but also compatible with

from mere glimpses of their visible parts. To address this, we present Vista3D,
a framework that realizes swift and consistent 3D generation within a mere 5
minutes. At the heart of Vista3D lies a two-phase approach: the coarse phase
and the fine phase. In the coarse phase, we rapidly generate initial geometry
with Gaussian Splatting from a single image. In the fine phase, we extract a
Signed Distance Function (SDF) directly from learned Gaussian Splatting,
optimizing it with a differentiable isosurface representation. Furthermore, it
elevates the quality of generation by using a disentangled representation with
two independent implicit functions to capture both visible and obscured aspects
of objects. Additionally, it harmonizes gradients from 2D diffusion prior with
3D-aware diffusion priors by angular diffusion prior composition. Through
extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that Vista3D effectively sustains a

NeRF to close-range imagery, estimating basic Microfacet BRDF models, which
fall short for many Earth surfaces. Moreover, high-quality NeRFs generally
require several images captured simultaneously, a rare occurrence in satellite

levels at different focal distances of the same scene in the focal stack, the
framework predicts the defocus map and Circle of Confusion (CoC) from a single
defocused image, using the defocus map as input to DepthNet for monocular depth
estimation. The 3D Gaussian splatting model renders defocused images using the
predicted CoC, and the differences between these and the real defocused images
provide additional supervision signals for the Siamese Defocus self-supervised

Instead of directly using Spherical Harmonics (SH) to model the appearance of
dynamic objects, we introduce and integrate a new method aiming at dynamically

dynamic objects appearance in both space and time. Besides object appearance,
DENSER enhances object shape representation through densification of its point

adaptive radius to narrow the rendering pixel range for each Gaussian, and
introduces a load balancing method to minimize thread waiting time during the
pixel-parallel rendering. Our contributions are threefold, achieving a
rendering speed of 310% while maintaining equivalent or even better quality
than the state-of-the-art. Firstly, we propose to early cull Gaussian-Tile
pairs of low splatting opacity based on an adaptive radius in the
Gaussian-parallel Preprocess stage, which reduces the number of affected tile
through the Gaussian bounding circle, thus reducing unnecessary overhead and
achieving faster rendering speed. Secondly, we further propose early culling
based on axis-aligned bounding box for Gaussian splatting, which achieves a
more significant reduction in ineffective expenses by accurately calculating
the Gaussian size in the 2D directions. Thirdly, we propose a balancing
algorithm for pixel thread load, which compresses the information of heavy-load
pixels to reduce thread waiting time, and enhance information of light-load
pixels to hedge against rendering quality loss. Experiments on three datasets

synthesis and novel view synthesis tasks. Typically, the initialization of 3D
Gaussian primitives relies on point clouds derived from Structure-from-Motion
(SfM) methods. However, in scenarios requiring scene reconstruction from sparse
viewpoints, the effectiveness of 3DGS is significantly constrained by the
quality of these initial point clouds and the limited number of input images.
In this study, we present Dust-GS, a novel framework specifically designed to
overcome the limitations of 3DGS in sparse viewpoint conditions. Instead of
relying solely on SfM, Dust-GS introduces an innovative point cloud
initialization technique that remains effective even with sparse input data.
Our approach leverages a hybrid strategy that integrates an adaptive
depth-based masking technique, thereby enhancing the accuracy and detail of
reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark

which is most often captured under a single illumination condition; It is
especially hard for full scenes containing multiple objects. We introduce a
method to create relightable radiance fields using such single-illumination
data by exploiting priors extracted from 2D image diffusion models. We first
fine-tune a 2D diffusion model on a multi-illumination dataset conditioned by
light direction, allowing us to augment a single-illumination capture into a
realistic -- but possibly inconsistent -- multi-illumination dataset from
directly defined light directions. We use this augmented data to create a
relightable radiance field represented by 3D Gaussian splats. To allow direct
control of light direction for low-frequency lighting, we represent appearance
with a multi-layer perceptron parameterized on light direction. To enforce
multi-view consistency and overcome inaccuracies we optimize a per-image
auxiliary feature vector. We show results on synthetic and real multi-view data
under single illumination, demonstrating that our method successfully exploits
2D diffusion model priors to allow realistic 3D relighting for complete scenes.

Splatting from 2D masks. Conventional methods often rely on iterative gradient
descent to assign each Gaussian a unique label, leading to lengthy optimization

a linear function with respect to the labels of each Gaussian. As such, the
optimal label assignment can be solved via linear programming in closed form.
This solution capitalizes on the alpha blending characteristic of the splatting
process for single step optimization. By incorporating the background bias in
our objective function, our method shows superior robustness in 3D segmentation
against noises. Remarkably, our optimization completes within 30 seconds, about
50$\times$ faster than the best existing methods. Extensive experiments

comparison to visible light imaging, thermal infrared imaging offers the
advantage of all-weather imaging and strong penetration, providing increased
possibilities for reconstruction in nighttime and adverse weather scenarios.
However, thermal infrared imaging is influenced by physical characteristics
such as atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction, hindering the
precise reconstruction of intricate details in thermal infrared scenes,
manifesting as issues of floaters and indistinct edge features in synthesized
images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a physics-induced
3D Gaussian splatting method named Thermal3D-GS. Thermal3D-GS begins by
modeling atmospheric transmission effects and thermal conduction in
three-dimensional media using neural networks. Additionally, a temperature
consistency constraint is incorporated into the optimization objective to
enhance the reconstruction accuracy of thermal infrared images. Furthermore, to
validate the effectiveness of our method, the first large-scale benchmark
dataset for this field named Thermal Infrared Novel-view Synthesis Dataset
(TI-NSD) is created. This dataset comprises 20 authentic thermal infrared video
scenes, covering indoor, outdoor, and UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) scenarios,
totaling 6,664 frames of thermal infrared image data. Based on this dataset,
this paper experimentally verifies the effectiveness of Thermal3D-GS. The
results indicate that our method outperforms the baseline method with a 3.03 dB
improvement in PSNR and significantly addresses the issues of floaters and

enabling users to freely navigate immersive virtual experiences and narrowing
the gap between digital and real worlds. However, the need for extensive manual
intervention to stabilize mesh sequences and the generation of excessively
large assets in existing workflows impedes broader adoption. In this paper, we
present a novel Gaussian-based approach, dubbed \textit{DualGS}, for real-time
and high-fidelity playback of complex human performance with excellent
compression ratios. Our key idea in DualGS is to separately represent motion
and appearance using the corresponding skin and joint Gaussians. Such an
explicit disentanglement can significantly reduce motion redundancy and enhance
temporal coherence. We begin by initializing the DualGS and anchoring skin
Gaussians to joint Gaussians at the first frame. Subsequently, we employ a
coarse-to-fine training strategy for frame-by-frame human performance modeling.
It includes a coarse alignment phase for overall motion prediction as well as a
fine-grained optimization for robust tracking and high-fidelity rendering. To
integrate volumetric video seamlessly into VR environments, we efficiently
compress motion using entropy encoding and appearance using codec compression
coupled with a persistent codebook. Our approach achieves a compression ratio
of up to 120 times, only requiring approximately 350KB of storage per frame. We

attention in computer vision and computer graphics due to its high rendering
speed and remarkable quality. While extant research has endeavored to extend
the application of 3DGS from static to dynamic scenes, such efforts have been
consistently impeded by excessive model sizes, constraints on video duration,

streamability of dynamic 3D Gaussian models, thereby restricting their utility
in downstream applications, including volumetric video, autonomous vehicle, and
immersive technologies such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality.
  This paper introduces SwinGS, a novel framework for training, delivering, and

aforementioned challenges and enhance streamability, SwinGS integrates
spacetime Gaussian with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to adapt the model to
fit various 3D scenes across frames, in the meantime employing a sliding window
captures Gaussian snapshots for each frame in an accumulative way. We implement
a prototype of SwinGS and demonstrate its streamability across various datasets

Light Field (NeLF) has been introduced to predict the color of a ray directly.
Unlike Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), NeLF does not create a point-wise
representation by predicting color and volume density for each point in space.
However, the current NeLF methods face a challenge as they need to train a NeRF
model first and then synthesize over 10K views to train NeLF for improved
performance. Additionally, the rendering quality of NeLF methods is lower
compared to NeRF methods. In this paper, we propose G-NeLF, a versatile
grid-based NeLF approach that utilizes spatial-aware features to unleash the
potential of the neural network's inference capability, and consequently
overcome the difficulties of NeLF training. Specifically, we employ a
spatial-aware feature sequence derived from a meticulously crafted grid as the
ray's representation. Drawing from our empirical studies on the adaptability of
multi-resolution hash tables, we introduce a novel grid-based ray
representation for NeLF that can represent the entire space with a very limited
number of parameters. To better utilize the sequence feature, we design a
lightweight ray color decoder that simulates the ray propagation process,
enabling a more efficient inference of the ray's color. G-NeLF can be trained
without necessitating significant storage overhead and with the model size of
only 0.95 MB to surpass previous state-of-the-art NeLF. Moreover, compared with

Gaussian distributions, which are parameterized by three points (mesh faces).
Subsequently, each 3D point (mesh face node) is treated as a discrete entity

smaller patches, leading to distortions that degrade perceptual quality. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel 2D-3D hybrid colored point cloud
upsampling framework (GaussianPU) based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for
robotic perception. This approach leverages 3DGS to bridge 3D point clouds with
their 2D rendered images in robot vision systems. A dual scale rendered image
restoration network transforms sparse point cloud renderings into dense
representations, which are then input into 3DGS along with precise robot camera
poses and interpolated sparse point clouds to reconstruct dense 3D point
clouds. We have made a series of enhancements to the vanilla 3DGS, enabling
precise control over the number of points and significantly boosting the
quality of the upsampled point cloud for robotic scene understanding. Our
framework supports processing entire point clouds on a single consumer-grade
GPU, such as the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, eliminating the need for segmentation
and thus producing high-quality, dense colored point clouds with millions of
points for robot navigation and manipulation tasks. Extensive experimental
results on generating million-level point cloud data validate the effectiveness
of our method, substantially improving the quality of colored point clouds and
demonstrating significant potential for applications involving large-scale
point clouds in autonomous robotics and human-robot interaction scenarios.";Zixuan Guo<author:sep>Yifan Xie<author:sep>Weijing Xie<author:sep>Peng Huang<author:sep>Fei Ma<author:sep>Fei Richard Yu;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01581v1;cs.RO;7 pages, 5 figures;gaussian splatting

Tracking points allow for geometric reconstruction [14], while geometric

overcome occlusion ambiguities by lifting tracking directly into 3D [38].
However, above approaches either require offline processing or multi-view

Gaussians to capture new content and object motions while estimating camera
movements from a single RGB frame. DynOMo stands out by enabling emergence of
point trajectories through robust image feature reconstruction and a novel
similarity-enhanced regularization term, without requiring any

attention for its ability to represent 3D scenes in a perceptually accurate
manner. However, it can require a substantial amount of storage since each
splat's individual data must be stored. While compression techniques offer a
potential solution by reducing the memory footprint, they still necessitate
retrieving the entire scene before any part of it can be rendered. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach for progressively rendering such scenes,
aiming to display visible content that closely approximates the final scene as
early as possible without loading the entire scene into memory. This approach
benefits both on-device rendering applications limited by memory constraints
and streaming applications where minimal bandwidth usage is preferred. To
achieve this, we approximate the contribution of each Gaussian to the final
scene and construct an order of prioritization on their inclusion in the
rendering process. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be
combined with existing compression methods to progressively render (and stream)
3DGS scenes, optimizing bandwidth usage by focusing on the most important
splats within a scene. Overall, our work establishes a foundation for making

condensing 3D NeRF representations into compact sets of decorated key points.
We demonstrate that our pre-trained model provides good initialization for

In this work, we develop GameIR, a large-scale high-quality

is a powerful 3D representation for novel view synthesis, as -- compared to
other approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields -- it provides fast scene
renderings and user control over the scene. Recent pre-prints have demonstrated
that the style of Gaussian Splatting scenes can be modified using an image
exemplar. However, since the scene geometry remains fixed during the
stylization process, current solutions fall short of producing satisfactory
results. Our algorithm aims to address these limitations by following a
three-step process: In a pre-processing step, we remove undesirable Gaussians
with large projection areas or highly elongated shapes. Subsequently, we
combine several losses carefully designed to preserve different scales of the
style in the image, while maintaining as much as possible the integrity of the
original scene content. During the stylization process and following the
original design of Gaussian Splatting, we split Gaussians where additional
detail is necessary within our scene by tracking the gradient of the stylized
color. Our experiments demonstrate that G-Style generates high-quality
stylizations within just a few minutes, outperforming existing methods both

leveraging the expressive power of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and fast
transfer of their features to learn accurate occupancy fields. Existing 3D
reconstruction methods from sparse inputs still struggle with capturing
intricate geometric details and can suffer from limitations in handling
occluded regions. On the other hand, NeRFs excel in modeling complex scenes but
do not offer means to extract meaningful geometry. Our proposed method offers
the best of both worlds by transferring the information encoded in NeRF
features to derive an accurate occupancy field representation. We utilize a
pre-trained, generalizable state-of-the-art NeRF network to capture detailed
scene radiance information, and rapidly transfer this knowledge to train a
generalizable implicit occupancy network. This process helps in leveraging the
knowledge of the scene geometry encoded in the generalizable NeRF prior and
refining it to learn occupancy fields, facilitating a more precise
generalizable representation of 3D space. The transfer learning approach leads
to a dramatic reduction in training time, by orders of magnitude (i.e. from
several days to 3.5 hrs), obviating the need to train generalizable sparse
surface reconstruction methods from scratch. Additionally, we introduce a novel
loss on volumetric rendering weights that helps in the learning of accurate
occupancy fields, along with a normal loss that helps in global smoothing of
the occupancy fields. We evaluate our approach on the DTU dataset and

groundbreaking progress in neural rendering, but the general fidelity of
large-scale road scene renderings is often limited by the input imagery, which
usually has a narrow field of view and focuses mainly on the street-level local

complementary viewpoint for the data from the ground vehicle's perspective,
enhancing the completeness of scene reconstruction and rendering. However,
training naively with aerial and ground images, which exhibit large view
disparity, poses a significant convergence challenge for 3D-GS, and does not
demonstrate remarkable improvements in performance on road views. In order to
enhance the novel view synthesis of road views and to effectively use the

aerial images to assist in the synthesis of areas where ground images have poor
learning outcomes instead of weighting all pixels equally in 3D-GS training

inpainter while collecting photo-realistic 3D-consistent pseudo novel views.
Finally, the refined mesh is converted into a 3D Gaussian Splatting field and
trained with the collected pseudo novel views. This pipeline enables the
reconstruction of real-world 3D scenes, even in the presence of large

exploiting the 3D structure encoded in the different representations. Next, we
present a global localization system that relies on the synthetic image

constrained optimization problem for volume rendering. Existing methods address
this issue by relying on supplementary information, such as depth maps.
However, generating this supplementary information accurately remains
problematic and often leads to NeRF producing images with undesired artifacts.
To address these artifacts and enhance robustness, we propose SSNeRF, a sparse
view semi supervised NeRF method based on a teacher student framework. Our key
idea is to challenge the NeRF module with progressively severe sparse view
degradation while providing high confidence pseudo labels. This approach helps
the NeRF model become aware of noise and incomplete information associated with
sparse views, thus improving its robustness. The novelty of SSNeRF lies in its
sparse view specific augmentations and semi supervised learning mechanism. In
this approach, the teacher NeRF generates novel views along with confidence
scores, while the student NeRF, perturbed by the augmented input, learns from
the high confidence pseudo labels. Our sparse view degradation augmentation
progressively injects noise into volume rendering weights, perturbs feature
maps in vulnerable layers, and simulates sparse view blurriness. These
augmentation strategies force the student NeRF to recognize degradation and
produce clearer rendered views. By transferring the student's parameters to the
teacher, the teacher gains increased robustness in subsequent training
iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our SSNeRF
in generating novel views with less sparse view degradation. We will release
code upon acceptance.";Xiao Cao<author:sep>Beibei Lin<author:sep>Bo Wang<author:sep>Zhiyong Huang<author:sep>Robby T. Tan;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09144v1;cs.CV;;nerf

we address indoor dense surface reconstruction by revisiting key aspects of
NeRF in order to use the recently proposed Vector Field (VF) as the implicit

surface point. It therefore flips direction at the surface and equals to the
explicit surface normals. Except for this flip, VF remains constant along
planar surfaces and provides a strong inductive bias in representing planar
surfaces. Concretely, we develop a novel density-VF relationship and a training

problem with applications ranging from naval robots to VR experiences. The
problem was successfully tackled by fully volumetric NeRF-based methods which
can model both the geometry and the medium (water). Unfortunately, these

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method offered a fast alternative to NeRFs.
However, because it is an explicit method that renders only the geometry, it

pivotal in various applications, attracting growing research interest. While
previous works on editing have achieved interesting results through
manipulating 3D meshes, they often require accurately reconstructed meshes to
perform editing, which limits their application in 3D content generation. To
address this gap, we introduce a novel single-image-driven 3D scene editing
approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling intuitive manipulation via
directly editing the content on a 2D image plane. Our method learns to optimize
the 3D Gaussians to align with an edited version of the image rendered from a

deformation, we introduce positional loss into the optimization process of 3D
Gaussian Splatting and enable gradient propagation through reparameterization.
To handle occluded 3D Gaussians when rendering from the specified viewpoint, we
build an anchor-based structure and employ a coarse-to-fine optimization
strategy capable of handling long-range deformation while maintaining
structural stability. Furthermore, we design a novel masking strategy to
adaptively identify non-rigid deformation regions for fine-scale modeling.

that combines physically-based rendering with Gaussian-based radiance field
rendering using a distillation progress map. Taking multi-view images as input,
our method starts from a pre-trained radiance field guidance, and distills
physically-based light and material parameters from the radiance field using an
image-fitting process. The distillation progress map is initialized to a small
value, which favors radiance field rendering. During early iterations when
fitted light and material parameters are far from convergence, the radiance
field fallback ensures the sanity of image loss gradients and avoids local
minima that attracts under-fit states. As fitted parameters converge, the
physical model gradually takes over and the distillation progress increases
correspondingly. In presence of light paths unmodeled by the physical model,
the distillation progress never finishes on affected pixels and the learned
radiance field stays in the final rendering. With this designed tolerance for
physical model limitations, we prevent unmodeled color components from leaking
into light and material parameters, alleviating relighting artifacts.
Meanwhile, the remaining radiance field compensates for the limitations of the
physical model, guaranteeing high-quality novel views synthesis. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
techniques quality-wise in both novel view synthesis and relighting. The idea
of progressive radiance distillation is not limited to Gaussian splatting. We

grid-based and implicit-based. Implicit methods, using multi-layer perceptrons

Conversely, grid-based methods require significant memory and struggle with
image quality and long training times. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian

trajectory of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), offering an exhilarating avenue
for navigating complex building structures. Yet, traditional Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF) methods face challenges such as sampling single points per
iteration and requiring an extensive array of views for supervision. UAV videos
exacerbate these issues with limited viewpoints and significant spatial scale
variations, resulting in inadequate detail rendering across diverse scales. In
response, we introduce FPV-NeRF, addressing these challenges through three key
facets: (1) Temporal consistency. Leveraging spatio-temporal continuity ensures
seamless coherence between frames; (2) Global structure. Incorporating various
global features during point sampling preserves space integrity; (3) Local
granularity. Employing a comprehensive framework and multi-resolution
supervision for multi-scale scene feature representation tackles the
intricacies of UAV video spatial scales. Additionally, due to the scarcity of
publicly available FPV videos, we introduce an innovative view synthesis method
using NeRF to generate FPV perspectives from UAV footage, enhancing spatial
perception for drones. Our novel dataset spans diverse trajectories, from
outdoor to indoor environments, in the UAV domain, differing significantly from
traditional NeRF scenarios. Through extensive experiments encompassing both
interior and exterior building structures, FPV-NeRF demonstrates a superior
understanding of the UAV flying space, outperforming state-of-the-art methods

capabilities since their data association usually relies on feature
correspondences. Additionally, learning-based SLAM systems often fall short in
terms of real-time performance and accuracy. Balancing real-time performance
with dense 3D reconstruction capabilities is a challenging problem. In this
paper, we propose a real-time RGB-D SLAM system that incorporates a novel view
synthesis technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting, for 3D scene representation and
pose estimation. This technique leverages the real-time rendering performance
of 3D Gaussian Splatting with rasterization and allows for differentiable
optimization in real time through CUDA implementation. We also enable mesh
reconstruction from 3D Gaussians for explicit dense 3D reconstruction. To
estimate accurate camera poses, we utilize a rotation-translation decoupled
strategy with inverse optimization. This involves iteratively updating both in
several iterations through gradient-based optimization. This process includes
differentiably rendering RGB, depth, and silhouette maps and updating the
camera parameters to minimize a combined loss of photometric loss, depth
geometry loss, and visibility loss, given the existing 3D Gaussian map.
However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles to accurately represent
surfaces due to the multi-view inconsistency of 3D Gaussians, which can lead to
reduced accuracy in both camera pose estimation and scene reconstruction. To
address this, we utilize depth priors as additional regularization to enforce
geometric constraints, thereby improving the accuracy of both pose estimation
and 3D reconstruction. We also provide extensive experimental results on public

representation that leverages a 3D Gaussian-based representation and introduces
an approximated volumetric rendering, achieving very fast rendering speed and
promising image quality. Furthermore, subsequent studies have successfully
extended 3DGS to dynamic 3D scenes, demonstrating its wide range of
applications. However, a significant drawback arises as 3DGS and its following
methods entail a substantial number of Gaussians to maintain the high fidelity

address this critical issue, we place a specific emphasis on two key
objectives: reducing the number of Gaussian points without sacrificing
performance and compressing the Gaussian attributes, such as view-dependent
color and covariance. To this end, we propose a learnable mask strategy that
significantly reduces the number of Gaussians while preserving high
performance. In addition, we propose a compact but effective representation of

geometric and temporal attributes by residual vector quantization. With model
compression techniques such as quantization and entropy coding, we consistently
show over 25x reduced storage and enhanced rendering speed compared to 3DGS for
static scenes, while maintaining the quality of the scene representation. For

learning volumetric 3D representation from several images of different views.
However, it is difficult to reconstruct a sharp NeRF from blurry input as it
often occurs in the wild. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Efficient
Event-Enhanced NeRF (E$^3$NeRF) by utilizing the combination of RGB images and
event streams. To effectively introduce event streams into the neural
volumetric representation learning process, we propose an event-enhanced blur
rendering loss and an event rendering loss, which guide the network via
modeling the real blur process and event generation process, respectively.
Specifically, we leverage spatial-temporal information from the event stream to
evenly distribute learning attention over temporal blur while simultaneously
focusing on blurry texture through the spatial attention. Moreover, a camera
pose estimation framework for real-world data is built with the guidance of the
events to generalize the method to practical applications. Compared to previous
image-based or event-based NeRF, our framework makes more profound use of the
internal relationship between events and images. Extensive experiments on both

with the prevalence of 3D Gaussians Splatting. In general, GS-based methods
comprise two key stages: initialization and rendering optimization. To achieve
initialization, existing works directly apply random sphere initialization or
3D diffusion models, e.g., Point-E, to derive the initial shapes. However, such
strategies suffer from two critical yet challenging problems: 1) the final
shapes are still similar to the initial ones even after training; 2) shapes can
be produced only from simple texts, e.g., ""a dog"", not for lexically richer
texts, e.g., ""a dog is sitting on the top of the airplane"". To address these
problems, this paper proposes a novel general framework to boost the 3D GS
Initialization for text-to-3D generation upon the lexical richness. Our key
idea is to aggregate 3D Gaussians into spatially uniform voxels to represent
complex shapes while enabling the spatial interaction among the 3D Gaussians
and semantic interaction between Gaussians and texts. Specifically, we first
construct a voxelized representation, where each voxel holds a 3D Gaussian with
its position, scale, and rotation fixed while setting opacity as the sole
factor to determine a position's occupancy. We then design an initialization
network mainly consisting of two novel components: 1) Global Information
Perception (GIP) block and 2) Gaussians-Text Fusion (GTF) block. Such a design
enables each 3D Gaussian to assimilate the spatial information from other areas
and semantic information from texts. Extensive experiments show the superiority
of our framework of high-quality 3D GS initialization against the existing
methods, e.g., Shap-E, by taking lexically simple, medium, and hard texts.
Also, our framework can be seamlessly plugged into SoTA training frameworks,
e.g., LucidDreamer, for semantically consistent text-to-3D generation.";Lutao Jiang<author:sep>Hangyu Li<author:sep>Lin Wang;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01269v1;cs.CV;;

success using diffusion priors. However, these methods are not suitable for
object insertion and replacement tasks as they do not consider the background,
leading to illumination mismatches within the environment. To bridge the gap,
we introduce an illumination-aware 3D scene editing pipeline for 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) representation. Our key observation is that inpainting by the
state-of-the-art conditional 2D diffusion model is consistent with background
in lighting. To leverage the prior knowledge from the well-trained diffusion
models for 3D object generation, our approach employs a coarse-to-fine
objection optimization pipeline with inpainted views. In the first coarse step,
we achieve image-to-3D lifting given an ideal inpainted view. The process
employs 3D-aware diffusion prior from a view-conditioned diffusion model, which
preserves illumination present in the conditioning image. To acquire an ideal
inpainted image, we introduce an Anchor View Proposal (AVP) algorithm to find a
single view that best represents the scene illumination in target region. In
the second Texture Enhancement step, we introduce a novel Depth-guided
Inpainting Score Distillation Sampling (DI-SDS), which enhances geometry and

transfer framework for expressive volume visualization (VolVis) via neural

ability to accurately separate the underlying scene geometry (i.e., content)

scene reconstruction space enabling high-fidelity novel view synthesis in
real-time. However, with the exception of RawNeRF, all prior 3DGS and
NeRF-based methods rely on 8-bit tone-mapped Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images for
scene reconstruction. Such methods struggle to achieve accurate reconstructions
in scenes that require a higher dynamic range. Examples include scenes captured
in nighttime or poorly lit indoor spaces having a low signal-to-noise ratio, as
well as daylight scenes with shadow regions exhibiting extreme contrast. Our
proposed method HDRSplat tailors 3DGS to train directly on 14-bit linear raw
images in near darkness which preserves the scenes' full dynamic range and
content. Our key contributions are two-fold: Firstly, we propose a linear HDR
space-suited loss that effectively extracts scene information from noisy dark
regions and nearly saturated bright regions simultaneously, while also handling
view-dependent colors without increasing the degree of spherical harmonics.
Secondly, through careful rasterization tuning, we implicitly overcome the
heavy reliance and sensitivity of 3DGS on point cloud initialization. This is
critical for accurate reconstruction in regions of low texture, high depth of
field, and low illumination. HDRSplat is the fastest method to date that does
14-bit (HDR) 3D scene reconstruction in $\le$15 minutes/scene ($\sim$30x faster
than prior state-of-the-art RawNeRF). It also boasts the fastest inference

This paper introduces a novel neural rendering method termed Decoupled Hybrid

in the decoupled and hybrid pixel-level blender for road and non-road layers,

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with mesh representations. We use meshes for the
room layout of the indoor scene, such as walls, ceilings, and floors, while
employing 3D Gaussians for other objects. This hybrid approach leverages the

because it is not clear which primitive should affect which part of the

training, particularly when the room layout is textureless, which can lead to
incorrect optimizations and unnecessary 3D Gaussians. To overcome these
challenges, we employ Segment Anything Model (SAM) to guide the selection of
primitives. The SAM mask loss enforces each instance to be represented by
either Gaussians or meshes, ensuring clear separation and stable training.

Instead, our method estimates a 6DoF pose by inverting the 3DGS rendering

3DGS model. Each Ellicell ray is associated with the rendering parameters of
each ellipsoid, which in turn is used to obtain the best bindings between the
target image pixels and the cast rays. These pixel-ray bindings are then ranked
to select the best scoring bundle of rays, which their intersection provides
the camera center and, in turn, the camera rotation. The proposed solution
obviates the necessity of an ""a priori"" pose for initialization, and it solves
6DoF pose estimation in closed form, without the need for iterations. Moreover,

speed of Instant-NGP to achieve real-time novel view synthesis. As a classic
NeRF-based method, Instant-NGP stores implicit features in multi-level grids or
hash tables and applies a shallow MLP to convert the implicit features into
explicit colors and densities. Although it achieves fast training speed, there
is still a lot of room for improvement in its rendering speed due to the
per-point MLP executions for implicit multi-level feature aggregation,
especially for real-time applications. To address this challenge, our proposed
NGP-RT explicitly stores colors and densities as hash features, and leverages a
lightweight attention mechanism to disambiguate the hash collisions instead of
using computationally intensive MLP. At the rendering stage, NGP-RT
incorporates a pre-computed occupancy distance grid into the ray marching
strategy to inform the distance to the nearest occupied voxel, thereby reducing
the number of marching points and global memory access. Experimental results

this paper, we present a Diffusion-based restoration method for anti-aliasing

a low-level restoration perspective by viewing aliasing artifacts as a kind of
degradation model added to clean ground truths. By leveraging the powerful
prior knowledge encapsulated in diffusion model, we could restore the
high-realism anti-aliasing renderings conditioned on aliased low-quality
counterparts. We further employ a feature-wrapping operation to ensure
multi-view restoration consistency and finetune the VAE decoder to better adapt

content-aligned reference image is an emerging research area. Starting with a
pretrained neural radiance field (NeRF), existing methods typically learn a
novel appearance that matches the given style. Despite their effectiveness,
they inherently suffer from time-consuming volume rendering, and thus are
impractical for many real-time applications. In this work, we propose ReGS,
which adapts 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reference-based stylization to
enable real-time stylized view synthesis. Editing the appearance of a
pretrained 3DGS is challenging as it uses discrete Gaussians as 3D
representation, which tightly bind appearance with geometry. Simply optimizing
the appearance as prior methods do is often insufficient for modeling
continuous textures in the given reference image. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel texture-guided control mechanism that adaptively adjusts local
responsible Gaussians to a new geometric arrangement, serving for desired
texture details. The proposed process is guided by texture clues for effective
appearance editing, and regularized by scene depth for preserving original
geometric structure. With these novel designs, we show ReGs can produce

simultaneous optimization of blur kernels and NeRF from sparse view.
Sparse-DeRF successfully regularizes the complicated joint optimization,
presenting alleviated overfitting artifacts and enhanced quality on radiance

smoothness, helps the model accurately predict the scene structure utilizing
unseen and additional hidden rays derived from the blur kernel based on
statistical tendencies of real-world; Modulated gradient scaling, helps the
model adjust the amount of the backpropagated gradient according to the

However, NeRF often encounters issues when there are not enough images to work

NeRF lacks sufficient structural details to guide the rendering process
accurately. To address this, we proposed a Depth and Normal Dense Completion
Priors for NeRF (CP\_NeRF) framework. This framework enhances view rendering by
adding depth and normal dense completion priors to the NeRF optimization
process. Before optimizing NeRF, we obtain sparse depth maps using the
Structure from Motion (SfM) technique used to get camera poses. Based on the
sparse depth maps and a normal estimator, we generate sparse normal maps for
training a normal completion prior with precise standard deviations. During
optimization, we apply depth and normal completion priors to transform sparse
data into dense depth and normal maps with their standard deviations. We use
these dense maps to guide ray sampling, assist distance sampling and construct
a normal loss function for better training accuracy. To improve the rendering
of NeRF's normal outputs, we incorporate an optical centre position embedder
that helps synthesize more accurate normals through volume rendering.
Additionally, we employ a normal patch matching technique to choose accurate

photometric inconsistencies. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose
the first SfM-free 3DGS-based method for surgical scene reconstruction by
jointly optimizing the camera poses and scene representation. Based on the
video continuity, the key of our method is to exploit the immediate optical
flow priors to guide the projection flow derived from 3D Gaussians. Unlike most
previous methods relying on photometric loss only, we formulate the pose
estimation problem as minimizing the flow loss between the projection flow and
optical flow. A consistency check is further introduced to filter the flow
outliers by detecting the rigid and reliable points that satisfy the epipolar
geometry. During 3D Gaussian optimization, we randomly sample frames to
optimize the scene representations to grow the 3D Gaussian progressively.

duration under low-count conditions, as encountered in Lu-177 SPECT imaging, by
developing a self-supervised learning approach to synthesize skipped SPECT

employed a self-supervised coordinate-based learning technique, adapting the

under-sampled SPECT projection views. For each single scan, we used
self-supervised coordinate learning to estimate skipped SPECT projection views.
The method was tested with various down-sampling factors (DFs=2, 4, 8) on both

patients undergoing Lu-177 DOTATATE and 6 patients undergoing Lu-177 PSMA-617

outperformed the use of linearly interpolated projections and partial

different downsampling factors: 1) DOTATATE: 83% vs. 65% vs. 67% for lesions

holds a significant advantage by inherently easing rapid convergence during
training and offering extensive editability. However, despite rapid
advancements, the literature still lives in its infancy regarding the
scalability of these models. In this study, we take some initial steps in
addressing this gap, showing an approach that enables both the memory and
computational scalability of such models. Specifically, we propose ""Trimming
the fat"", a post-hoc gradient-informed iterative pruning technique to eliminate
redundant information encoded in the model. Our experimental findings on widely
acknowledged benchmarks attest to the effectiveness of our approach, revealing
that up to 75% of the Gaussians can be removed while maintaining or even
improving upon baseline performance. Our approach achieves around 50$\times$

synthesis, exhibiting clear strengths in efficiency, photometric quality, and
compositional edibility. Following its success, many works have extended
Gaussians to 4D, showing that dynamic Gaussians maintain these benefits while
also tracking scene geometry far better than alternative representations. Yet,
these methods assume dense multi-view videos as supervision, constraining their
use to controlled capture settings. In this work, we extend the capability of
Gaussian scene representations to casually captured monocular videos. We show
that existing 4D Gaussian methods dramatically fail in this setup because the
monocular setting is underconstrained. Building off this finding, we propose
Dynamic Gaussian Marbles (DGMarbles), consisting of three core modifications
that target the difficulties of the monocular setting. First, DGMarbles uses
isotropic Gaussian ""marbles"", reducing the degrees of freedom of each Gaussian,
and constraining the optimization to focus on motion and appearance over local
shape. Second, DGMarbles employs a hierarchical divide-and-conquer learning
strategy to guide the optimization towards solutions with coherent motion.
Finally, DGMarbles adds image-level and geometry-level priors into the
optimization, including a tracking loss that takes advantage of recent progress
in point tracking. By constraining the optimization in these ways, DGMarbles
learns Gaussian trajectories that enable novel-view rendering and accurately
capture the 3D motion of the scene elements. We evaluate on the (monocular)
Nvidia Dynamic Scenes dataset and the Dycheck iPhone dataset, and show that
DGMarbles significantly outperforms other Gaussian baselines in quality, and is
on-par with non-Gaussian representations, all while maintaining the efficiency,
compositionality, editability, and tracking benefits of Gaussians.";Colton Stearns<author:sep>Adam Harley<author:sep>Mikaela Uy<author:sep>Florian Dubost<author:sep>Federico Tombari<author:sep>Gordon Wetzstein<author:sep>Leonidas Guibas;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18717v1;cs.CV;;gaussian splatting

due to its superior visual quality and rendering speed. However, 3DGS training
currently occurs on a single GPU, limiting its ability to handle
high-resolution and large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks due to memory
constraints. We introduce Grendel, a distributed system designed to partition
3DGS parameters and parallelize computation across multiple GPUs. As each
Gaussian affects a small, dynamic subset of rendered pixels, Grendel employs
sparse all-to-all communication to transfer the necessary Gaussians to pixel
partitions and performs dynamic load balancing. Unlike existing 3DGS systems
that train using one camera view image at a time, Grendel supports batched
training with multiple views. We explore various optimization hyperparameter
scaling strategies and find that a simple sqrt(batch size) scaling rule is
highly effective. Evaluations using large-scale, high-resolution scenes show
that Grendel enhances rendering quality by scaling up 3DGS parameters across
multiple GPUs. On the Rubble dataset, we achieve a test PSNR of 27.28 by
distributing 40.4 million Gaussians across 16 GPUs, compared to a PSNR of 26.28

exponential reduction of the sample space size from an initially large value.
This methodology is crucial for stabilizing the early stages of the training

We introduce a novel approach to quickly edit a 3D model from a single
reference view. Our technique first segments the edit image, and then matches
semantically corresponding regions across chosen segmented dataset views using
DINO features. A color or texture change from a particular region of the edit
image can then be applied to other views automatically in a semantically
sensible manner. These edited views act as an updated dataset to further train
and re-style the 3D scene. The end-result is therefore an edited 3D model. Our
framework enables a wide variety of editing tasks such as manual local edits,
correspondence based style transfer from any example image, and a combination
of different styles from multiple example images. We use Gaussian Splats as our
primary 3D representation due to their speed and ease of local editing, but our
technique works for other methods such as NeRFs as well. We show through
multiple examples that our method produces higher quality results while

to concurrently learn the underlying 3D NeRF representation and a mapping from
images to camera extrinsic parameters. To facilitate the latter, we design a
custom network architecture to represent pose as a distribution, granting

geometry and physical properties of an object from video sequences without any
geometric assumptions. Recently, physics-augmented continuum neural radiance
fields (PAC-NeRF) has demonstrated promising results for this technique by
utilizing a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian representation, in which the geometry is
represented by the Eulerian grid representations of NeRF, the physics is
described by a material point method (MPM), and they are connected via
Lagrangian particles. However, a notable limitation of PAC-NeRF is that its
performance is sensitive to the learning of the geometry from the first frames
owing to its two-step optimization. First, the grid representations are
optimized with the first frames of video sequences, and then the physical
properties are optimized through video sequences utilizing the fixed
first-frame grid representations. This limitation can be critical when learning
of the geometric structure is difficult, for example, in a few-shot (sparse

(3DGS) models, as the point initiation (e.g., via structure from motion) is
distributionally inappropriate. Typically, the Adaptive Density Control (ADC)
algorithm is applied, leveraging view-averaged gradient magnitude thresholding
for point densification, opacity thresholding for pruning, and regular
all-points opacity reset. However, we reveal that this strategy is limited in
tackling intricate/special image regions (e.g., transparent) as it is unable to
identify all the 3D zones that require point densification, and lacking an
appropriate mechanism to handle the ill-conditioned points with negative
impacts (occlusion due to false high opacity). To address these limitations, we
propose a Localized Point Management (LPM) strategy, capable of identifying
those error-contributing zones in the highest demand for both point addition
and geometry calibration. Zone identification is achieved by leveraging the
underlying multiview geometry constraints, with the guidance of image rendering
errors. We apply point densification in the identified zone, whilst resetting
the opacity of those points residing in front of these regions so that a new
opportunity is created to correct ill-conditioned points. Serving as a
versatile plugin, LPM can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D Gaussian
Splatting models. Experimental evaluation across both static 3D and dynamic 4D

One promising alternative is rasterization-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS),
providing a much faster rendering speed and explicit 3D representation. In this
paper, we exploit Gaussian as a 3D representation for 3D GANs by leveraging its
efficient and explicit characteristics. However, in an adversarial framework,
we observe that a na\""ive generator architecture suffers from training
instability and lacks the capability to adjust the scale of Gaussians. This
leads to model divergence and visual artifacts due to the absence of proper
guidance for initialized positions of Gaussians and densification to manage
their scales adaptively. To address these issues, we introduce a generator
architecture with a hierarchical multi-scale Gaussian representation that
effectively regularizes the position and scale of generated Gaussians.
Specifically, we design a hierarchy of Gaussians where finer-level Gaussians
are parameterized by their coarser-level counterparts; the position of
finer-level Gaussians would be located near their coarser-level counterparts,
and the scale would monotonically decrease as the level becomes finer, modeling
both coarse and fine details of the 3D scene. Experimental results demonstrate
that ours achieves a significantly faster rendering speed (x100) compared to

the motion of each 3D Gaussian more precisely. By joint optimizing meshes, 3D

for precise mesh extraction and real-time rendering but is limited in handling
large topological changes in meshes, leading to optimization challenges.
Alternatively, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is favored in both training and
rendering efficiency while falling short in mesh extraction. In this work, we
introduce a novel 3D representation, Tetrahedron Splatting (TeT-Splatting),
that supports easy convergence during optimization, precise mesh extraction,

surface-based volumetric rendering within a structured tetrahedral grid while
preserving the desired ability of precise mesh extraction, and a tile-based
differentiable tetrahedron rasterizer. Furthermore, we incorporate eikonal and
normal consistency regularization terms for the signed distance field to
improve generation quality and stability. Critically, our representation can be
trained without mesh extraction, making the optimization process easier to
converge. Our TeT-Splatting can be readily integrated in existing 3D generation

Gaussian and a small number of child 3D Gaussians. Parent 3D Gaussians are
learned as done in the vanilla Splatter Image. Child 3D Gaussians are learned
via a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) which takes as input the
projected image features of a parent 3D Gaussian and the embedding of a target
camera view. Both parent and child 3D Gaussians are learned end-to-end in a
stage-wise way. The joint condition of input image features from eyes of the

allocate child Gaussians to ``see the unseen'', recovering the occluded details
that are often missed by parent Gaussians.

intricate scenes accurately. One of the most widely used methods for this
purpose is Gaussian Splatting, a novel approach that is known for its rapid
training and inference capabilities. In essence, Gaussian Splatting involves
incorporating data about the 3D objects of interest into a series of Gaussian
distributions, each of which can then be depicted in 3D in a manner analogous
to traditional meshes. It is regrettable that the use of Gaussians in Gaussian
Splatting is currently somewhat restrictive due to their perceived linear
nature. In practice, 3D objects are often composed of complex curves and highly
nonlinear structures. This issue can to some extent be alleviated by employing
a multitude of Gaussian components to reflect the complex, nonlinear structures
accurately. However, this approach results in a considerable increase in time
complexity. This paper introduces the concept of negative Gaussians, which are
interpreted as items with negative colors. The rationale behind this approach
is based on the density distribution created by dividing the probability
density functions (PDFs) of two Gaussians, which we refer to as Diff-Gaussian.
Such a distribution can be used to approximate structures such as donut and
moon-shaped datasets. Experimental findings indicate that the application of
these techniques enhances the modeling of high-frequency elements with rapid

inevitably led to a significant increase in memory usage. Additionally,
effectively rendering dynamic scenes in 3D-GS has emerged as a pressing

encoding and a tiny MLP to reduce storage requirements. Subsequently, we

Finally, motion noise of points is mitigated through static constraints and

Nonetheless, a comprehensive discussion regarding their effectiveness and

categorize 3DGS pruning techniques into two types: Cross-view pruning and
pixel-wise pruning, which differ in their approaches to rank primitives. Our
subsequent experiments reveal that while cross-view pruning leads to disastrous
quality drops under extreme Gaussian primitives decimation, the pixel-wise

backbones, thus lacking the ability to accurately localize 3D Gaussian and
support free-view synthesis across wide view range. In this paper, we present a
novel framework FreeSplat that is capable of reconstructing geometrically
consistent 3D scenes from long sequence input towards free-view
synthesis.Specifically, we firstly introduce Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation
achieved by constructing adaptive cost volumes among nearby views and
aggregating features using a multi-scale structure. Subsequently, we present
the Pixel-wise Triplet Fusion to eliminate redundancy of 3D Gaussians in
overlapping view regions and to aggregate features observed across multiple
views. Additionally, we propose a simple but effective free-view training
strategy that ensures robust view synthesis across broader view range
regardless of the number of views. Our empirical results demonstrate
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis peformances in both novel view rendered
color maps quality and depth maps accuracy across different numbers of input
views. We also show that FreeSplat performs inference more efficiently and can
effectively reduce redundant Gaussians, offering the possibility of
feed-forward large scene reconstruction without depth priors.";Yunsong Wang<author:sep>Tianxin Huang<author:sep>Hanlin Chen<author:sep>Gim Hee Lee;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17958v1;cs.CV;;gaussian splatting

cameras is crucial for autonomous driving. However, removing all temporarily
static objects, such as stopped vehicles and standing pedestrians, presents a
significant challenge. Unlike object-centric 3D inpainting, which relies on
thorough observation in a small scene, street scene cases involve long
trajectories that differ from previous 3D inpainting tasks. The camera-centric
moving environment of captured videos further complicates the task due to the
limited degree and time duration of object observation. To address these
obstacles, we introduce StreetUnveiler to reconstruct an empty street.
StreetUnveiler learns a 3D representation of the empty street from crowded
observations. Our representation is based on the hard-label semantic 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) for its scalability and ability to identify Gaussians
to be removed. We inpaint rendered image after removing unwanted Gaussians to
provide pseudo-labels and subsequently re-optimize the 2DGS. Given its temporal
continuous movement, we divide the empty street scene into observed,
partial-observed, and unobserved regions, which we propose to locate through a
rendered alpha map. This decomposition helps us to minimize the regions that
need to be inpainted. To enhance the temporal consistency of the inpainting, we
introduce a novel time-reversal framework to inpaint frames in reverse order
and use later frames as references for earlier frames to fully utilize the
long-trajectory observations. Our experiments conducted on the street scene
dataset successfully reconstructed a 3D representation of the empty street. The
mesh representation of the empty street can be extracted for further
applications. The project page and more visualizations can be found at:

Conventional methods usually rely on the assumptions of multi-view video
inputs, known camera parameters, or static scenes, all of which are typically
absent under in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we relax all these
constraints and tackle a highly ambitious but practical task, which we termed
as AnyV4D: we assume only one monocular video is available without any camera
parameters as input, and we aim to recover the dynamic 4D world alongside the
camera poses. To this end, we introduce GFlow, a new framework that utilizes
only 2D priors (depth and optical flow) to lift a video (3D) to a 4D explicit
representation, entailing a flow of Gaussian splatting through space and time.
GFlow first clusters the scene into still and moving parts, then applies a
sequential optimization process that optimizes camera poses and the dynamics of
3D Gaussian points based on 2D priors and scene clustering, ensuring fidelity
among neighboring points and smooth movement across frames. Since dynamic
scenes always introduce new content, we also propose a new pixel-wise
densification strategy for Gaussian points to integrate new visual content.
Moreover, GFlow transcends the boundaries of mere 4D reconstruction; it also
enables tracking of any points across frames without the need for prior
training and segments moving objects from the scene in an unsupervised way.
Additionally, the camera poses of each frame can be derived from GFlow,
allowing for rendering novel views of a video scene through changing camera
pose. By employing the explicit representation, we may readily conduct
scene-level or object-level editing as desired, underscoring its versatility

manipulating NeRF is not highly controllable and requires a long training and

photorealistic images from novel viewpoints using HDR imaging techniques. The
rendered HDR images capture a wider range of brightness levels containing more
details of the scene than normal low dynamic range (LDR) images. Existing HDR
NVS methods are mainly based on NeRF. They suffer from long training time and
slow inference speed. In this paper, we propose a new framework, High Dynamic
Range Gaussian Splatting (HDR-GS), which can efficiently render novel HDR views

in the fields of 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Given that
training a 3DGS requires a significant amount of time and computational cost,
it is crucial to protect the copyright, integrity, and privacy of such 3D
assets. Steganography, as a crucial technique for encrypted transmission and
copyright protection, has been extensively studied. However, it still lacks
profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. Unlike its predecessor NeRF, 3DGS
possesses two distinct features: 1) explicit 3D representation; and 2)
real-time rendering speeds. These characteristics result in the 3DGS point
cloud files being public and transparent, with each Gaussian point having a
clear physical significance. Therefore, ensuring the security and fidelity of
the original 3D scene while embedding information into the 3DGS point cloud

achieving state-of-the-art quality in novel view synthesis significantly faster
than competing alternatives. However, its use of spherical harmonics to
represent scene colors limits the expressivity of 3D Gaussians and, as a
consequence, the capability of the representation to generalize as we move away
from the training views. In this paper, we propose to encode the color
information of 3D Gaussians into per-Gaussian feature vectors, which we denote
as Feature Splatting (FeatSplat). To synthesize a novel view, Gaussians are
first ""splatted"" into the image plane, then the corresponding feature vectors
are alpha-blended, and finally the blended vector is decoded by a small MLP to
render the RGB pixel values. To further inform the model, we concatenate a
camera embedding to the blended feature vector, to condition the decoding also
on the viewpoint information. Our experiments show that these novel model for
encoding the radiance considerably improves novel view synthesis for low
overlap views that are distant from the training views. Finally, we also show
the capacity and convenience of our feature vector representation,
demonstrating its capability not only to generate RGB values for novel views,
but also their per-pixel semantic labels. We will release the code upon

modification of 3D Gaussian scenes has become increasingly vital. This process
entails accurately retrieve the target objects and subsequently performing

because of the fundamental limitation of Gaussians and point clouds -- each

When training two 3D Gaussian radiance fields with the same sparse views of a

disagreement} and \textit{rendering disagreement} that can unsupervisedly
predict reconstruction quality, stemming from the sampling implementation in
densification. We further quantify the point disagreement and rendering

disagreements and accurate reconstruction, which allows us to identify
inaccurate reconstruction without accessing ground-truth information. Based on
the study, we propose CoR-GS, which identifies and suppresses inaccurate

present a plug-and-play inpainting module, dubbed differentiable neural-point

ray locations within the implicit space, thereby facilitating object removal &

between ground truth and predicted implicit features, potentially increasing
the mutual information (MI) of the features across rays. Then, we leverage DNR

large-scale aerial rendering poses two critical problems. Firstly, a single
NeRF cannot render the entire scene with high-precision for complex large-scale
aerial datasets since the sampling range along each view ray is insufficient to
cover buildings adequately. Secondly, traditional NeRFs are infeasible to train
on one GPU to enable interactive fly-throughs for modeling massive images.
Instead, existing methods typically separate the whole scene into multiple
regions and train a NeRF on each region, which are unaccustomed to different

existing methods are characterized by lengthy generation processes or

narrow-field viewpoint iterative generations, compromising global consistency

framework for fast and higher-quality 3D scene generation, while maintaining
the scene consistency. Specifically, given a text prompt, we generate a
panorama and estimate its depth, since the panorama encompasses information
about the entire scene and exhibits explicit geometric constraints. To obtain
high-quality novel views, we introduce the Coarse View Synthesis (CVS) and
Progressive Novel View Inpainting (PNVI) strategies, ensuring both scene
consistency and view quality. Subsequently, we utilize Multi-View Projection

scene reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate FastScene surpasses
other methods in both generation speed and quality with better scene

our observation, these point-based neural re-rendering methods are only
expected to perform well under ideal conditions and suffer from noisy, patchy
points and unbounded scenes, which are challenging to handle but defacto common
in real applications. To this end, we revisit one such influential method,
known as Neural Point-based Graphics (NPBG), as our baseline, and propose
Robust Point-based Graphics (RPBG). We in-depth analyze the factors that
prevent NPBG from achieving satisfactory renderings on generic datasets, and
accordingly reform the pipeline to make it more robust to varying datasets
in-the-wild. Inspired by the practices in image restoration, we greatly enhance
the neural renderer to enable the attention-based correction of point
visibility and the inpainting of incomplete rasterization, with only acceptable
overheads. We also seek for a simple and lightweight alternative for
environment modeling and an iterative method to alleviate the problem of poor

Notably, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is in the spotlight as a means to
synthesize high-quality 3D talking head outputs. Unfortunately, this NeRF-based
approach typically requires a large number of paired audio-visual data for each
identity, thereby limiting the scalability of the method. Although there have
been attempts to generate audio-driven 3D talking head animations with a single
image, the results are often unsatisfactory due to insufficient information on
obscured regions in the image. In this paper, we mainly focus on addressing the
overlooked aspect of 3D consistency in the one-shot, audio-driven domain, where
facial animations are synthesized primarily in front-facing perspectives. We
propose a novel method, NeRFFaceSpeech, which enables to produce high-quality
3D-aware talking head. Using prior knowledge of generative models combined with
NeRF, our method can craft a 3D-consistent facial feature space corresponding
to a single image. Our spatial synchronization method employs audio-correlated
vertex dynamics of a parametric face model to transform static image features
into dynamic visuals through ray deformation, ensuring realistic 3D facial
motion. Moreover, we introduce LipaintNet that can replenish the lacking
information in the inner-mouth area, which can not be obtained from a given
single image. The network is trained in a self-supervised manner by utilizing
the generative capabilities without additional data. The comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in generating

directly on the signal, leading to a dense representation of the signal. Even
with some techniques such as pruning or distillation, the results are still
dense. In this paper, we propose to model the gradient of the original signal.
The gradients are much sparser than the original signal. Therefore, the
gradients use much less Gaussian splats, leading to the more efficient storage
and thus higher computational performance during both training and rendering.
Thanks to the sparsity, during the view synthesis, only a small mount of pixels
are needed, leading to much higher computational performance ($100\sim
1000\times$ faster). And the 2D image can be recovered from the gradients via
solving a Poisson equation with linear computation complexity. Several

with the potential to revolutionize typical photogrammetric workflows, such as
those used for 3D scene reconstruction. As input, NeRFs require multi-view
images with corresponding camera poses as well as the interior orientation. In
the typical NeRF workflow, the camera poses and the interior orientation are
estimated in advance with Structure from Motion (SfM). But the quality of the
resulting novel views, which depends on different parameters such as the number
and distribution of available images, as well as the accuracy of the related
camera poses and interior orientation, is difficult to predict. In addition,
SfM is a time-consuming pre-processing step, and its quality strongly depends
on the image content. Furthermore, the undefined scaling factor of SfM hinders
subsequent steps in which metric information is required. In this paper, we
evaluate the potential of NeRFs for industrial robot applications. We propose
an alternative to SfM pre-processing: we capture the input images with a
calibrated camera that is attached to the end effector of an industrial robot
and determine accurate camera poses with metric scale based on the robot
kinematics. We then investigate the quality of the novel views by comparing
them to ground truth, and by computing an internal quality measure based on
ensemble methods. For evaluation purposes, we acquire multiple datasets that
pose challenges for reconstruction typical of industrial applications, like
reflective objects, poor texture, and fine structures. We show that the
robot-based pose determination reaches similar accuracy as SfM in non-demanding
cases, while having clear advantages in more challenging scenarios. Finally, we

scene and learn each sub-region using an individual NeRF. Such partitioning
strategies help volume-based NeRF exceed the single GPU memory limit and scale
to larger scenes. However, this approach requires multiple background NeRF to
handle out-of-partition rays, which leads to redundancy of learning. Inspired
by the fact that the background of current partition is the foreground of
adjacent partition, we propose a scalable scene reconstruction method based on
joint Multi-resolution Hash Grids, named DistGrid. In this method, the scene is
divided into multiple closely-paved yet non-overlapped Axis-Aligned Bounding

problem of great practical interest, especially when camera poses are absent or

of the coupling between poses and depths, and inaccuracies in monocular depth

using monocular depth and projecting pixels back into the 3D world. During
construction, we optimize the solution by detecting 2D correspondences between
training views and the corresponding rendered images. We develop a unified
differentiable pipeline for camera registration and adjustment of both camera
poses and depths, followed by back-projection. We also introduce a novel notion
of an expected surface in Gaussian splatting, which is critical to our
optimization. These steps enable a coarse solution, which can then be low-pass
filtered and refined using standard optimization methods. We demonstrate
results on the Tanks and Temples and Static Hikes datasets with as few as three

  To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach called MVIP-NeRF

addressing both appearance and geometry aspects. MVIP-NeRF performs joint
inpainting across multiple views to reach a consistent solution, which is
achieved via an iterative optimization process based on Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS). Apart from recovering the rendered RGB images, we also extract
normal maps as a geometric representation and define a normal SDS loss that
motivates accurate geometry inpainting and alignment with the appearance.
Additionally, we formulate a multi-view SDS score function to distill

task of neural 3D scene reconstruction has led to the exploration of various
techniques. Among these, 3D Gaussian Splatting stands out for its explicit
representation of scenes using 3D Gaussians, making it appealing for tasks like
3D point cloud extraction and surface reconstruction. Motivated by its
potential, we address the domain of 3D scene reconstruction, aiming to leverage
the capabilities of the Microsoft HoloLens 2 for instant 3D Gaussian Splatting.
We present HoloGS, a novel workflow utilizing HoloLens sensor data, which
bypasses the need for pre-processing steps like Structure from Motion by
instantly accessing the required input data i.e. the images, camera poses and
the point cloud from depth sensing. We provide comprehensive investigations,
including the training process and the rendering quality, assessed through the
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, and the geometric 3D accuracy of the densified
point cloud from Gaussian centers, measured by Chamfer Distance. We evaluate
our approach on two self-captured scenes: An outdoor scene of a cultural
heritage statue and an indoor scene of a fine-structured plant. Our results

a Ripmap-Encoded Platonic Solid representation to precisely and efficiently

anisotropic 3D areas can be projected onto planes with distinguishable
characterization. Meanwhile, each face of the Platonic solid is encoded by the
Ripmap encoding, which is constructed by anisotropically pre-filtering a
learnable feature grid, to enable featurzing the projected anisotropic areas
both precisely and efficiently by the anisotropic area-sampling. Extensive

better scalability through the automatic creation of digital 3D assets.
However, reconstruction quality suffers on street scenes due to largely
collinear camera motions and sparser samplings at higher speeds. On the other

ground-truth pose supervision. Existing methods usually adopt a pairwise
training strategy based on differentiable rendering, which enforces the
photometric and the geometric consistency between the two registered frames as
supervision. However, this frame-to-frame framework suffers from poor
multi-view consistency due to factors such as lighting changes, geometry
occlusion and reflective materials. In this paper, we present NeRF-UR, a novel
frame-to-model optimization framework for unsupervised RGB-D registration.
Instead of frame-to-frame consistency, we leverage the neural radiance field
(NeRF) as a global model of the scene and use the consistency between the input
and the NeRF-rerendered frames for pose optimization. This design can
significantly improve the robustness in scenarios with poor multi-view
consistency and provides better learning signal for the registration model.
Furthermore, to bootstrap the NeRF optimization, we create a synthetic dataset,
Sim-RGBD, through a photo-realistic simulator to warm up the registration
model. By first training the registration model on Sim-RGBD and later
unsupervisedly fine-tuning on real data, our framework enables distilling the
capability of feature extraction and registration from simulation to reality.

attention for its fast rendering speed and high rendering quality. However,
this comes with high memory consumption, e.g., a well-trained Gaussian field
may utilize three million Gaussian primitives and over 700 MB of memory. We
credit this high memory footprint to the lack of consideration for the
relationship between primitives. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient
Gaussian field named SUNDAE with spectral pruning and neural compensation. On
one hand, we construct a graph on the set of Gaussian primitives to model their
relationship and design a spectral down-sampling module to prune out primitives
while preserving desired signals. On the other hand, to compensate for the
quality loss of pruning Gaussians, we exploit a lightweight neural network head
to mix splatted features, which effectively compensates for quality losses
while capturing the relationship between primitives in its weights. We
demonstrate the performance of SUNDAE with extensive results. For example,
SUNDAE can achieve 26.80 PSNR at 145 FPS using 104 MB memory while the vanilla

improve the performance of object removal in NeRF. However, these methods are
either costly or time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
that integrates monocular depth estimates with NeRF-based object removal models
to significantly reduce time consumption and enhance the robustness and quality
of scene generation and object removal. We conducted a thorough evaluation of
COLMAP's dense depth reconstruction on the KITTI dataset to verify its accuracy
in depth map generation. Our findings suggest that COLMAP can serve as an
effective alternative to a ground truth depth map where such information is
missing or costly to obtain. Additionally, we integrated various monocular

depth in a different way from color rendering, we let a single opaque Gaussian
well fit a local surface region without the need of multiple overlapping
Gaussians, hence largely reducing the memory and computation cost. For
on-the-fly Gaussian optimization, we explicitly add Gaussians for three types

a training-free approach which integrates cues from the underlying 3D geometry

these methods neglect the inherent 3D structure of the scene, thereby
restricting the expressivity and the quality of the representation, resulting

and reduced storage requirements on benchmark novel-view synthesis datasets.
SAGS is founded on a local-global graph representation that facilitates the

preserve the scene's geometry. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight version
of SAGS, using a simple yet effective mid-point interpolation scheme, which
showcases a compact representation of the scene with up to 24$\times$ size

great success in the field of novel view synthesis. However, specular
reflection remains non-trivial, as the high frequency radiance field is
notoriously difficult to fit stably and accurately. We present a deferred
shading method to effectively render specular reflection with Gaussian
splatting. The key challenge comes from the environment map reflection model,
which requires accurate surface normal while simultaneously bottlenecks normal
estimation with discontinuous gradients. We leverage the per-pixel reflection
gradients generated by deferred shading to bridge the optimization process of
neighboring Gaussians, allowing nearly correct normal estimations to gradually
propagate and eventually spread over all reflective objects. Our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and concurrent work in
synthesizing high-quality specular reflection effects, demonstrating a
consistent improvement of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for both synthetic

for expanding the scope of X-ray CT applications. However, they face challenges
due to incomplete data acquisition, resulting in diverse artifacts in the
reconstructed CT images. Emerging implicit neural representation (INR)
techniques, such as NeRF, NeAT, and NeRP, have shown promise in
under-determined CT imaging reconstruction tasks. However, the unsupervised
nature of INR architecture imposes limited constraints on the solution space,
particularly for the highly ill-posed reconstruction task posed by LACT and
ultra-SVCT. In this study, we introduce the Diffusion Prior Driven Neural
Representation (DPER), an advanced unsupervised framework designed to address
the exceptionally ill-posed CT reconstruction inverse problems. DPER adopts the
Half Quadratic Splitting (HQS) algorithm to decompose the inverse problem into
data fidelity and distribution prior sub-problems. The two sub-problems are
respectively addressed by INR reconstruction scheme and pre-trained score-based
diffusion model. This combination initially preserves the implicit image local
consistency prior from INR. Additionally, it effectively augments the
feasibility of the solution space for the inverse problem through the
generative diffusion model, resulting in increased stability and precision in
the solutions. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance
of DPER on LACT and ultra-SVCT reconstruction with two public datasets (AAPM

practices involve constructing variance-based cost volumes for geometry
reconstruction and encoding 3D descriptors for decoding novel views. However,
existing methods show limited generalization ability in challenging conditions
due to inaccurate geometry, sub-optimal descriptors, and decoding strategies.
We address these issues point by point. First, we find the variance-based cost
volume exhibits failure patterns as the features of pixels corresponding to the
same point can be inconsistent across different views due to occlusions or
reflections. We introduce an Adaptive Cost Aggregation (ACA) approach to
amplify the contribution of consistent pixel pairs and suppress inconsistent
ones. Unlike previous methods that solely fuse 2D features into descriptors,
our approach introduces a Spatial-View Aggregator (SVA) to incorporate 3D
context into descriptors through spatial and inter-view interaction. When
decoding the descriptors, we observe the two existing decoding strategies excel
in different areas, which are complementary. A Consistency-Aware Fusion (CAF)
strategy is proposed to leverage the advantages of both. We incorporate the
above ACA, SVA, and CAF into a coarse-to-fine framework, termed Geometry-aware

Triggered by a manifold of research activities, promising results have been
gained especially for texture-less, transparent, and reflecting surfaces, while
such scenarios remain challenging for traditional MVS-based approaches.
However, most of these investigations focus on close-range scenarios, with
studies for airborne scenarios still missing. For this task, NeRFs face
potential difficulties at areas of low image redundancy and weak data evidence,
as often found in street canyons, facades or building shadows. Furthermore,
training such networks is computationally expensive. Thus, the aim of our work

often yielding results that do not align with user expectations, thus limiting
their applicability. User-envisioning 3D object generation faces significant
challenges in realizing its concepts using current generative models due to
limited interaction capabilities. Existing methods mainly offer two approaches:
(i) interpreting textual instructions with constrained controllability, or (ii)
reconstructing 3D objects from 2D images. Both of them limit customization to

high-quality and real-time rendering of complex 3D scenes. Despite these
achievements, a notable challenge persists: it is difficult to precisely
reconstruct specific objects from large scenes. Current scene reconstruction
techniques frequently result in the loss of object detail textures and are
unable to reconstruct object portions that are occluded or unseen in views. To
address this challenge, we delve into the meticulous 3D reconstruction of
specific objects within large scenes and propose a framework termed OMEGAS:
Object Mesh Extraction from Large Scenes Guided by GAussian Segmentation.
OMEGAS employs a multi-step approach, grounded in several excellent
off-the-shelf methodologies. Specifically, initially, we utilize the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) to guide the segmentation of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
thereby creating a basic 3DGS model of the target object. Then, we leverage
large-scale diffusion priors to further refine the details of the 3DGS model,
especially aimed at addressing invisible or occluded object portions from the
original scene views. Subsequently, by re-rendering the 3DGS model onto the
scene views, we achieve accurate object segmentation and effectively remove the
background. Finally, these target-only images are used to improve the 3DGS
model further and extract the definitive 3D object mesh by the SuGaR model. In
various scenarios, our experiments demonstrate that OMEGAS significantly

While recent works like BARF have introduced camera pose optimization within

methods struggle while tackling complex trajectories involving large rotations.
To address this limitation, we propose CT-NeRF, an incremental reconstruction
optimization pipeline using only RGB images without pose and depth input. In
this pipeline, we first propose a local-global bundle adjustment under a pose
graph connecting neighboring frames to enforce the consistency between poses to
escape the local minima caused by only pose consistency with the scene
structure. Further, we instantiate the consistency between poses as a
reprojected geometric image distance constraint resulting from pixel-level
correspondences between input image pairs. Through the incremental
reconstruction, CT-NeRF enables the recovery of both camera poses and scene
structure and is capable of handling scenes with complex trajectories. We

differentiable rasterization to achieve high-quality novel view synthesis
results while providing advanced real-time rendering performance. However, due
to the flaw of its adaptive density control strategy in 3D-GS, it frequently
suffers from over-reconstruction issue in intricate scenes containing
high-frequency details, leading to blurry rendered images. The underlying
reason for the flaw has still been under-explored. In this work, we present a
comprehensive analysis of the cause of aforementioned artifacts, namely
gradient collision, which prevents large Gaussians in over-reconstructed
regions from splitting. To address this issue, we propose the novel
homodirectional view-space positional gradient as the criterion for
densification. Our strategy efficiently identifies large Gaussians in
over-reconstructed regions, and recovers fine details by splitting. We evaluate
our proposed method on various challenging datasets. The experimental results
indicate that our approach achieves the best rendering quality with reduced or
similar memory consumption. Our method is easy to implement and can be
incorporated into a wide variety of most recent Gaussian Splatting-based

To address this problem, we propose Super-Resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting

sub-pixel constraint is introduced for the increased viewpoints in HR space,
exploiting the sub-pixel cross-view information of the multiple low-resolution

densification of primitives. Furthermore, a pre-trained 2D super-resolution

reason is the high diversity of synthetic contents from the diffusion model,
which hinders the radiance field from converging to a crisp and deterministic
geometry. Moreover, applying latent diffusion models on real data often yields
a textural shift incoherent to the image condition due to auto-encoding errors.
These two problems are further reinforced with the use of pixel-distance
losses. To address these issues, we propose tempering the diffusion model's
stochasticity with per-scene customization and mitigating the textural shift

commonly used pixel and perceptual losses are harmful in the NeRF inpainting

computer graphics and computer vision. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) can

rendering by rasterizing Gaussian ellipsoids. However, Gaussian splatting
utilizes a single Spherical Harmonic (SH) function to model both texture and
lighting, limiting independent editing capabilities of these components.
Recently, attempts have been made to decouple texture and lighting with the
Gaussian splatting representation but may fail to produce plausible geometry
and decomposition results on reflective scenes. Additionally, the forward
shading technique they employ introduces noticeable blending artifacts during
relighting, as the geometry attributes of Gaussians are optimized under the
original illumination and may not be suitable for novel lighting conditions. To
address these issues, we introduce DeferredGS, a method for decoupling and

achieve successful decoupling, we model the illumination with a learnable

normal direction on Gaussians, where the normal is distilled from a jointly

rendering patches only for useful points rather than all pixels in the whole

such methods encounter the following limitations: 1) they require a set of
multi-view images as training data for a specific scene (e.g., face, car or
chair), which is often unavailable in many real-world scenarios; 2) they fail
to extract the geometry priors from single-view images due to the lack of
multi-view supervision. In this paper, we propose a Geometry-enhanced NeRF

multi-view synthesis approach, followed by a depth-aware training. In the
synthesis process, inspired that existing 3D GAN models can unconditionally
synthesize high-fidelity multi-view images, we seek to adopt off-the-shelf 3D

adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this progress, the cumbersome
optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle to efficiency. In this
paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for 3D generation without

prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion time-steps in
close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature maps across
neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model's inference in 3D

leverage the scene reconstruction power of a pre-trained neural radiance field
(NeRF). To successfully stylize a scene this way, one must first reconstruct a
photo-realistic radiance field from collected images of the scene. However,
when only sparse input views are available, pre-trained few-shot NeRFs often
suffer from high-frequency artifacts, which are generated as a by-product of
high-frequency details for improving reconstruction quality. Is it possible to
generate more faithful stylized scenes from sparse inputs by directly
optimizing encoding-based scene representation with target style? In this
paper, we consider the stylization of sparse-view scenes in terms of
disentangling content semantics and style textures. We propose a coarse-to-fine
sparse-view scene stylization framework, where a novel hierarchical
encoding-based neural representation is designed to generate high-quality
stylized scenes directly from implicit scene representations. We also propose a
new optimization strategy with content strength annealing to achieve realistic
stylization and better content preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can achieve high-quality stylization of sparse-view scenes and
outperforms fine-tuning-based baselines in terms of stylization quality and

dynamic scenes from monocular videos. In contrast to previous NeRF methods that
reconstruct dynamic scenes from the colors and volume densities of individual
points, Semantic Flow learns semantics from continuous flows that contain rich
3D motion information. As there is 2D-to-3D ambiguity problem in the viewing
direction when extracting 3D flow features from 2D video frames, we consider
the volume densities as opacity priors that describe the contributions of flow
features to the semantics on the frames. More specifically, we first learn a
flow network to predict flows in the dynamic scene, and propose a flow feature
aggregation module to extract flow features from video frames. Then, we propose
a flow attention module to extract motion information from flow features, which
is followed by a semantic network to output semantic logits of flows. We
integrate the logits with volume densities in the viewing direction to
supervise the flow features with semantic labels on video frames. Experimental
results show that our model is able to learn from multiple dynamic scenes and
supports a series of new tasks such as instance-level scene editing, semantic
completions, dynamic scene tracking and semantic adaption on novel scenes.

appearance editing. It can achieve consistent 3D artistic stylization given a
single reference style image and thus is a user-friendly editing way. However,
recent NeRF-based 3D stylization methods face efficiency issues that affect the
actual user experience and the implicit nature limits its ability to transfer
the geometric pattern styles. Additionally, the ability for artists to exert
flexible control over stylized scenes is considered highly desirable, fostering
an environment conducive to creative exploration. In this paper, we introduce
StylizedGS, a 3D neural style transfer framework with adaptable control over
perceptual factors based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation. The
3DGS brings the benefits of high efficiency. We propose a GS filter to
eliminate floaters in the reconstruction which affects the stylization effects
before stylization. Then the nearest neighbor-based style loss is introduced to
achieve stylization by fine-tuning the geometry and color parameters of 3DGS,
while a depth preservation loss with other regularizations is proposed to
prevent the tampering of geometry content. Moreover, facilitated by specially
designed losses, StylizedGS enables users to control color, stylized scale and
regions during the stylization to possess customized capabilities. Our method
can attain high-quality stylization results characterized by faithful

through the strategic utilization of object-centric camera poses characterized

alternative utility of NeRF: the derivation of point clouds from aggregated
urban landscape imagery. The transmutation of street-view data into point
clouds is fraught with complexities, attributable to a nexus of interdependent

poses, yet many datasets suffer from inaccuracies in pose metadata. Also, the
standard approach of NeRF is ill-suited for the distinct characteristics of

that using transient data (from sonars) allows us to address the missing cone
problem by sampling high-frequency data along the depth axis. We extend the
Gaussian splatting algorithms for two commonly used sonars and propose fusion
algorithms that simultaneously utilize RGB camera data and sonar data. Through

This goes beyond the traditional closed-set assumption, i.e., where models can

works on open-set segmentation in 3D scenes have appeared in the literature.
These methods are heavily influenced by closed-set 3D convolutional approaches

This motivates us to perform editing on low-frequency components, which results

the background in complex scenes shows a large variance among different views.
Second, the current inference pattern, $i.e.$, a pixel only relies on an

emerged as an efficient approach for accurate scene representation. It
optimizes the location, size, color, and shape of a cloud of 3D Gaussian
elements to visually match, after projection, or splatting, a set of given
images taken from various viewing directions. And yet, despite the proximity of
Gaussian elements to the shape boundaries, direct surface reconstruction of
objects in the scene is a challenge.
  We propose a novel approach for surface reconstruction from Gaussian
splatting models. Rather than relying on the Gaussian elements' locations as a
prior for surface reconstruction, we leverage the superior novel-view synthesis
capabilities of 3DGS. To that end, we use the Gaussian splatting model to
render pairs of stereo-calibrated novel views from which we extract depth
profiles using a stereo matching method. We then combine the extracted RGB-D
images into a geometrically consistent surface. The resulting reconstruction is
more accurate and shows finer details when compared to other methods for
surface reconstruction from Gaussian splatting models, while requiring
significantly less compute time compared to other surface reconstruction
methods.
  We performed extensive testing of the proposed method on in-the-wild scenes,
taken by a smartphone, showcasing its superior reconstruction abilities.

understand the 3D visual world such as inferring semantics, geometry, and
dynamics. Given the capabilities of neural fields in densely representing a 3D
scene from 2D images, we ask the question: Can we scale their self-supervised
pretraining, specifically using masked autoencoders, to generate effective 3D
representations from posed RGB images. Owing to the astounding success of
extending transformers to novel data modalities, we employ standard 3D Vision
Transformers to suit the unique formulation of NeRFs. We leverage NeRF's
volumetric grid as a dense input to the transformer, contrasting it with other
3D representations such as pointclouds where the information density can be
uneven, and the representation is irregular. Due to the difficulty of applying
masked autoencoders to an implicit representation, such as NeRF, we opt for
extracting an explicit representation that canonicalizes scenes across domains
by employing the camera trajectory for sampling. Our goal is made possible by
masking random patches from NeRF's radiance and density grid and employing a
standard 3D Swin Transformer to reconstruct the masked patches. In doing so,
the model can learn the semantic and spatial structure of complete scenes. We
pretrain this representation at scale on our proposed curated posed-RGB data,
totaling over 1.6 million images. Once pretrained, the encoder is used for
effective 3D transfer learning. Our novel self-supervised pretraining for

photorealistic reconstruction and real-time rendering of scenes using multiple

keyframe-based mapping and tracking utilizing loss functions that incorporate
relative pose transformations from pre-integrated inertial measurements, depth
estimates, and measures of photometric rendering quality. We also release a
multi-modal dataset, UT-MM, collected from a mobile robot equipped with a

unknown environment as a two-player zero-sum game: the agent aims to maximize
information gained from the environment while the environment aims to minimize
the information gained by the agent. In each episode, the environment reveals a
set of actions with their potentially erroneous information gain. In order to
select the best action, the robot needs to recover the true information gain
from the erroneous one. The robot does so by minimizing the discrepancy between
its estimate of information gain and the true information gain it observes
after taking the action. We propose an online convex optimization algorithm
that achieves sub-linear expected regret $O(T^{3/4})$ for estimating the
information gain. We also provide a bound on the regret of active perception
performed by any (near-)optimal prediction and trajectory selection algorithms.
We evaluate this approach using semantic neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in
simulated realistic 3D environments to show that the robot can discover up to
12% more objects using the improved estimate of the information gain. On the

Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), namely 3DGSR, that allows for accurate 3D
reconstruction with intricate details while inheriting the high efficiency and
rendering quality of 3DGS. The key insight is incorporating an implicit signed
distance field (SDF) within 3D Gaussians to enable them to be aligned and
jointly optimized. First, we introduce a differentiable SDF-to-opacity
transformation function that converts SDF values into corresponding Gaussians'
opacities. This function connects the SDF and 3D Gaussians, allowing for
unified optimization and enforcing surface constraints on the 3D Gaussians.
During learning, optimizing the 3D Gaussians provides supervisory signals for
SDF learning, enabling the reconstruction of intricate details. However, this
only provides sparse supervisory signals to the SDF at locations occupied by
Gaussians, which is insufficient for learning a continuous SDF. Then, to
address this limitation, we incorporate volumetric rendering and align the
rendered geometric attributes (depth, normal) with those derived from 3D
Gaussians. This consistency regularization introduces supervisory signals to
locations not covered by discrete 3D Gaussians, effectively eliminating
redundant surfaces outside the Gaussian sampling range. Our extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our 3DGSR method enables high-quality 3D
surface reconstruction while preserving the efficiency and rendering quality of
3DGS. Besides, our method competes favorably with leading surface
reconstruction techniques while offering a more efficient learning process and
much better rendering qualities. The code will be available at

avenue for alleviating the production burden in 3D applications. Previous
studies required significant effort to realize the desired scene, owing to
limited control conditions. We propose a method for controlling and generating
3D scenes under multimodal conditions using partial images, layout information
represented in the top view, and text prompts. Combining these conditions to
generate a 3D scene involves the following significant difficulties: (1) the
creation of large datasets, (2) reflection on the interaction of multimodal
conditions, and (3) domain dependence of the layout conditions. We decompose
the process of 3D scene generation into 2D image generation from the given
conditions and 3D scene generation from 2D images. 2D image generation is
achieved by fine-tuning a pretrained text-to-image model with a small
artificial dataset of partial images and layouts, and 3D scene generation is
achieved by layout-conditioned depth estimation and neural radiance fields
(NeRF), thereby avoiding the creation of large datasets. The use of a common
representation of spatial information using 360-degree images allows for the

end-to-end dense stereo models (DUSt3R) to tackle the complex yet unresolved

Coarse Geometric Initialization (CGI) module that swiftly establishes a

modifying the training procedure of Gaussian splatting, our method functions at

pretrained Gaussian splatting field as a plugin to significantly improve the
field's anti-alising performance. The core technique is to apply 2D
scale-adaptive filters to each Gaussian during test time. As pointed out by
Mip-Splatting, observing Gaussians at different frequencies leads to mismatches
between the Gaussian scales during training and testing. Mip-Splatting resolves
this issue using 3D smoothing and 2D Mip filters, which are unfortunately not
aware of testing frequency. In this work, we show that a 2D scale-adaptive
filter that is informed of testing frequency can effectively match the Gaussian
scale, thus making the Gaussian primitive distribution remain consistent across
different testing frequencies. When scale inconsistency is eliminated, sampling
rates smaller than the scene frequency result in conventional jaggedness, and
we propose to integrate the projected 2D Gaussian within each pixel during
testing. This integration is actually a limiting case of super-sampling, which
significantly improves anti-aliasing performance over vanilla Gaussian
Splatting. Through extensive experiments using various settings and both
bounded and unbounded scenes, we show SA-GS performs comparably with or better
than Mip-Splatting. Note that super-sampling and integration are only effective

However, a common challenge has been the compromise between parameter
efficiency and the accuracy of the model, where reduced parameters often lead
to diminished accuracy compared to their full-rank counterparts. In this work,
we propose a novel theoretical framework that integrates a sinusoidal function
within the low-rank decomposition process. This approach not only preserves the
benefits of the parameter efficiency characteristic of low-rank methods but
also increases the decomposition's rank, thereby enhancing model accuracy. Our
method proves to be an adaptable enhancement for existing low-rank models, as
evidenced by its successful application in Vision Transformers (ViT), Large

their position, and prevent them from moving independently during optimization.
Specifically, we introduce single and multiview constraints through an implicit

It plays a significant role in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases.
Improving the rendering quality and speed under sparse sampling is important
for observing the status and location of lesions. The current methods exhibit
inadequate rendering quality in sparse views and suffer from slow rendering
speed. To overcome these limitations, we propose TOGS, a Gaussian splatting

rendering quality and speed of 4D DSA. We introduce an opacity offset table for
each Gaussian to model the temporal variations in the radiance of the contrast
agent. By interpolating the opacity offset table, the opacity variation of the
Gaussian at different time points can be determined. This enables us to render
the 2D DSA image at that specific moment. Additionally, we introduced a Smooth

challenge in computer vision and computer graphics. Two main requirements lie
in rendering and reconstruction. Notably, SOTA rendering quality is usually
achieved with neural volumetric rendering techniques, which rely on aggregated
point/primitive-wise color and neglect the underlying scene geometry. Learning
of neural implicit surfaces is sparked from the success of neural rendering.
Current works either constrain the distribution of density fields or the shape
of primitives, resulting in degraded rendering quality and flaws on the learned
scene surfaces. The efficacy of such methods is limited by the inherent
constraints of the chosen neural representation, which struggles to capture
fine surface details, especially for larger, more intricate scenes. To address
these issues, we introduce GSDF, a novel dual-branch architecture that combines
the benefits of a flexible and efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
representation with neural Signed Distance Fields (SDF). The core idea is to
leverage and enhance the strengths of each branch while alleviating their
limitation through mutual guidance and joint supervision. We show on diverse

It provides a more compatible reconstruction for conventional rendering
engines, compared with the neural radiance fields (NeRFs). On the other hand,
existing NeRF-based inverse rendering methods cannot handle glossy objects with
local light interactions well, as they typically oversimplify the illumination
as a 2D environmental map, which assumes infinite lights only. Observing the
superiority of NeRFs in recovering radiance fields, we propose a novel 5D
Neural Plenoptic Function (NeP) based on NeRFs and ray tracing, such that more
accurate lighting-object interactions can be formulated via the rendering
equation. We also design a material-aware cone sampling strategy to efficiently
integrate lights inside the BRDF lobes with the help of pre-filtered radiance
fields. Our method has two stages: the geometry of the target object and the
pre-filtered environmental radiance fields are reconstructed in the first
stage, and materials of the target object are estimated in the second stage
with the proposed NeP and material-aware cone sampling strategy. Extensive
experiments on the proposed real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that

view synthesis, boasting rapid rendering speed with high fidelity. However, the
substantial Gaussians and their associated attributes necessitate effective
compression techniques. Nevertheless, the sparse and unorganized nature of the

compression. To address this, we make use of the relations between the
unorganized anchors and the structured hash grid, leveraging their mutual
information for context modeling, and propose a Hash-grid Assisted Context
(HAC) framework for highly compact 3DGS representation. Our approach introduces
a binary hash grid to establish continuous spatial consistencies, allowing us
to unveil the inherent spatial relations of anchors through a carefully

distributions to accurately estimate the probability of each quantized
attribute, where an adaptive quantization module is proposed to enable
high-precision quantization of these attributes for improved fidelity
restoration. Additionally, we incorporate an adaptive masking strategy to
eliminate invalid Gaussians and anchors. Importantly, our work is the pioneer
to explore context-based compression for 3DGS representation, resulting in a
remarkable size reduction of over $75\times$ compared to vanilla 3DGS, while

large-scale scenes. However, their limited model capacity typically results in
blurred rendering results. Existing large-scale NeRFs primarily address this
limitation by partitioning the scene into blocks, which are subsequently
handled by separate sub-NeRFs. These sub-NeRFs, trained from scratch and
processed independently, lead to inconsistencies in geometry and appearance
across the scene. Consequently, the rendering quality fails to exhibit
significant improvement despite the expansion of model capacity. In this work,
we present global-guided focal neural radiance field (GF-NeRF) that achieves
high-fidelity rendering of large-scale scenes. Our proposed GF-NeRF utilizes a
two-stage (Global and Focal) architecture and a global-guided training
strategy. The global stage obtains a continuous representation of the entire
scene while the focal stage decomposes the scene into multiple blocks and
further processes them with distinct sub-encoders. Leveraging this two-stage
architecture, sub-encoders only need fine-tuning based on the global encoder,
thus reducing training complexity in the focal stage while maintaining
scene-wide consistency. Spatial information and error information from the
global stage also benefit the sub-encoders to focus on crucial areas and
effectively capture more details of large-scale scenes. Notably, our approach
does not rely on any prior knowledge about the target scene, attributing

challenging task due to its under-constrained nature. While the optimization
can draw photometric reference from the input videos or be regulated by
generative models, directly supervising Gaussian motions remains underexplored.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept, Gaussian flow, which connects the
dynamics of 3D Gaussians and pixel velocities between consecutive frames. The
Gaussian flow can be efficiently obtained by splatting Gaussian dynamics into
the image space. This differentiable process enables direct dynamic supervision
from optical flow. Our method significantly benefits 4D dynamic content
generation and 4D novel view synthesis with Gaussian Splatting, especially for
contents with rich motions that are hard to be handled by existing methods. The
common color drifting issue that happens in 4D generation is also resolved with
improved Guassian dynamics. Superior visual quality on extensive experiments
demonstrates our method's effectiveness. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on both
tasks of 4D generation and 4D novel view synthesis. Project page:

accurately recover intricate details from severely motion-blurred images and
cannot achieve real-time rendering. In contrast, recent advancements in 3D
Gaussian Splatting achieve high-quality 3D scene reconstruction and real-time

state-of-the-art methods struggle to reconstruct high frequency detail, due to
factors such as a low-frequency bias of radiance fields and inaccurate camera

agnostic to scene geometry and do not easily generalize to new distributions of
image degradation. Conversely, existing 3D enhancers are able to transfer
detail from nearby training images in a generalizable manner, but suffer from
inaccurate camera calibration and can propagate errors from the geometry into
rendered images. We propose a neural rendering enhancer, RoGUENeRF, which
exploits the best of both paradigms. Our method is pre-trained to learn a
general enhancer while also leveraging information from nearby training images
via robust 3D alignment and geometry-aware fusion. Our approach restores
high-frequency textures while maintaining geometric consistency and is also

vision and graphics. While existing NeRF-based methods can achieve high-quality
novel view rendering of human models, both training and inference processes are
time-consuming. Recent approaches have utilized 3D Gaussians to represent the

importance of the mesh guidance and directly predict Gaussians in 3D space with
coarse mesh guidance. This hinders the learning procedure of the Gaussians and
tends to produce blurry textures. Therefore, we propose UV Gaussians, which
models the 3D human body by jointly learning mesh deformations and 2D UV-space
Gaussian textures. We utilize the embedding of UV map to learn Gaussian
textures in 2D space, leveraging the capabilities of powerful 2D networks to
extract features. Additionally, through an independent Mesh network, we
optimize pose-dependent geometric deformations, thereby guiding Gaussian

rendering has been proven to achieve convincing results in solving the problem
of modeling and rendering the 3D dynamic scene from 2D images. Despite this, in
the context of novel view synthesis, each type of primitive has its inherent
defects in terms of representation ability. It is difficult to exploit the mesh
to depict the fuzzy geometry. Meanwhile, the point-based splatting (e.g. the 3D
Gaussian Splatting) method usually produces artifacts or blurry pixels in the

even not impossible, to represent the complex and dynamic scene with a single
type of primitive. To this end, we propose a novel approach, GauMesh, to bridge
the 3D Gaussian and Mesh for modeling and rendering the dynamic scenes. Given a
sequence of tracked mesh as initialization, our goal is to simultaneously
optimize the mesh geometry, color texture, opacity maps, a set of 3D Gaussians,

the RGB and opacity values based on the merged and re-ordered z-buffers from

this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of neural scene

Specifically, we present four different strategies of how to incorporate a
second modality, other than RGB, into NeRFs: (1) training from scratch
independently on both modalities; (2) pre-training on RGB and fine-tuning on
the second modality; (3) adding a second branch; and (4) adding a separate

building-level instance segmentation from aerial images by lifting noisy 2D
labels to 3D. This is a challenging problem due to two primary reasons.
Firstly, objects in urban aerial images exhibit substantial variations in size,
including buildings, cars, and roads, which pose a significant challenge for
accurate 2D segmentation. Secondly, the 2D labels generated by existing
segmentation methods suffer from the multi-view inconsistency problem,
especially in the case of aerial images, where each image captures only a small
portion of the entire scene. To overcome these limitations, we first introduce
a scale-adaptive semantic label fusion strategy that enhances the segmentation
of objects of varying sizes by combining labels predicted from different
altitudes, harnessing the novel-view synthesis capabilities of NeRF. We then
introduce a novel cross-view instance label grouping strategy based on the 3D
scene representation to mitigate the multi-view inconsistency problem in the 2D
instance labels. Furthermore, we exploit multi-view reconstructed depth priors
to improve the geometric quality of the reconstructed radiance field, resulting

become widespread in their use in robotics for manipulation and object
representation; however, raw optical tactile sensor data is unsuitable to
directly supervise a 3DGS scene. Our representation leverages a Gaussian
Process Implicit Surface to implicitly represent the object, combining many
touches into a unified representation with uncertainty. We merge this model
with a monocular depth estimation network, which is aligned in a two stage

match our touch data. For every training image, our method produces a
corresponding fused depth and uncertainty map. Utilizing this additional

transfer, and decoding. Initially, 2D VGG scene features are embedded into
reconstructed 3D Gaussians. Next, the embedded features are transformed
according to a reference style image. Finally, the transformed features are
decoded into the stylized RGB. StyleGaussian has two novel designs. The first
is an efficient feature rendering strategy that first renders low-dimensional

synthesis by modeling the scene with a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) and a
volume rendering procedure, however, when fewer known views are given (i.e.,
few-shot view synthesis), the model is prone to overfit the given views. To
handle this issue, previous efforts have been made towards leveraging learned
priors or introducing additional regularizations. In contrast, in this paper,
we for the first time provide an orthogonal method from the perspective of
network structure. Given the observation that trivially reducing the number of
model parameters alleviates the overfitting issue, but at the cost of missing
details, we propose the multi-input MLP (mi-MLP) that incorporates the inputs
(i.e., location and viewing direction) of the vanilla MLP into each layer to
prevent the overfitting issue without harming detailed synthesis. To further
reduce the artifacts, we propose to model colors and volume density separately
and present two regularization terms. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that: 1) although the proposed mi-MLP is easy to
implement, it is surprisingly effective as it boosts the PSNR of the baseline
from $14.73$ to $24.23$. 2) the overall framework achieves state-of-the-art
results on a wide range of benchmarks. We will release the code upon

estimating per-pixel convolution kernels from a Blur Proposal Network (BPN).
BPN is designed to consider spatial, color, and depth variations of the scene

scanner to compute the camera information and then uniformly samples point
positions within a cuboid enclosing the scanned object. Experiments show that
our X-Gaussian outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 6.5 dB while enjoying

proxy for novel animation and texture transfer. By binding the 3D Gaussians in
texture space and re-projecting them back to world space through implicit shell
mapping, we show how our 3D modeling can serve as a valid rendering methodology
for interactive applications. It is further noted that recently, 3D mesh
reconstruction works have been able to produce high-quality mesh for rendering.
Our work, on the other hand, only requires an approximated geometry for
rendering an object in high fidelity. Applicationwise, we will show that our
proxy-based 3DGM is capable of driving novel animation without animated

Radiance Fields (NeRF), highlights a growing need for editing capabilities in
implicit 3D models, essential for tasks like scene post-processing and 3D

due to limitations in editing flexibility and quality. The key issue is
developing a neural representation that supports local edits for real-time
updates. Current NeRF editing methods, offering pixel-level adjustments or
detailed geometry and color modifications, are mostly limited to static scenes.
This paper introduces SealD-NeRF, an extension of Seal-3D for pixel-level
editing in dynamic settings, specifically targeting the D-NeRF network. It
allows for consistent edits across sequences by mapping editing actions to a

technique that leverages the concept of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). With
radial undersampling, the corresponding imaging problem can be reformulated
into an image modeling task from sparse-view rendered data; therefore, a high
dimensional MR image is obtainable from undersampled k-space data by taking
advantage of implicit neural representation. A multi-layer perceptron, which is
designed to output an image intensity from a spatial coordinate, learns the MR
physics-driven rendering relation between given measurement data and desired
image. Effective undersampling strategies for high-quality neural
representation are investigated. The proposed method serves two benefits: (i)
The learning is based fully on single undersampled k-space data, not a bunch of
measured data and target image sets. It can be used potentially for diagnostic
MR imaging, such as fetal MRI, where data acquisition is relatively rare or
limited against diversity of clinical images while undersampled reconstruction
is highly demanded. (ii) A reconstructed MR image is a scan-specific
representation highly adaptive to the given k-space measurement. Numerous
experiments validate the feasibility and capability of the proposed approach.";Tae Jun Jang<author:sep>Chang Min Hyun;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13226v2;eess.IV;;nerf

Moreover, based on the analysis of the frequency spectrum, we propose to apply

Leveraging the decomposition property in decomposed low-rank tensor, our method
achieves an equivalent effect to brute-force 3D convolution with only incurring
little computational overhead. To further improve the robustness and stability
of joint optimization, we also propose techniques of smoothed 2D supervision,

scene representation. However, most existing methods rely on large and costly
datasets with fine-grained 3D voxel labels for training, which limits their
practicality and scalability, increasing the need for self-monitored learning
in this domain. In this work, we present a novel approach to occupancy
estimation inspired by neural radiance field (NeRF) using only 2D labels, which
are considerably easier to acquire. In particular, we employ differentiable
volumetric rendering to predict depth and semantic maps and train a 3D network
based on 2D supervision only. To enhance geometric accuracy and increase the
supervisory signal, we introduce temporal rendering of adjacent time steps.
Additionally, we introduce occupancy flow as a mechanism to handle dynamic
objects in the scene and ensure their temporal consistency. Through extensive
experimentation we demonstrate that 2D supervision only is sufficient to
achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to methods using 3D labels, while
outperforming concurrent 2D approaches. When combining 2D supervision with 3D

In contrast, more expensive methods that model the scene's geometry as a
volumetric density field (e.g. NeRF) excel at reconstructing fine geometric

which hinders exact localization of the surface. In this work, we modify
density fields to encourage them to converge towards surfaces, without
compromising their ability to reconstruct thin structures. First, we employ a
discrete opacity grid representation instead of a continuous density field,
which allows opacity values to discontinuously transition from zero to one at
the surface. Second, we anti-alias by casting multiple rays per pixel, which
allows occlusion boundaries and subpixel structures to be modelled without
using semi-transparent voxels. Third, we minimize the binary entropy of the
opacity values, which facilitates the extraction of surface geometry by
encouraging opacity values to binarize towards the end of training. Lastly, we

accelerated training and inference without a decrease in rendering quality by
encoding the object's characteristics in a collection of Gaussian

computing and other domains. On the other hand, the emergence of deepfake
methods has sparked considerable controversy. Such techniques can have a form
of artificial intelligence-generated videos that closely mimic authentic
footage. Using generative models, they can modify facial features, enabling the
creation of altered identities or facial expressions that exhibit a remarkably
realistic appearance to a real person. Despite these controversies, deepfake
can offer a next-generation solution for avatar creation and gaming when of
desirable quality. To that end, we show how to combine all these emerging

splatting, driving 3D Gaussian points by rigging each point to a FLAME mesh. 2)
FLAME-based score distillation sampling, utilizing FLAME-based fine-grained

view-inconsistent semantics provided by CLIP. To tackle these limitations, we
propose OV-NeRF, which exploits the potential of pre-trained vision and

single-view and cross-view strategies. First, from the single-view perspective,
we introduce Region Semantic Ranking (RSR) regularization by leveraging 2D mask

view, facilitating accurate semantic field learning. Second, from the
cross-view perspective, we propose a Cross-view Self-enhancement (CSE) strategy

invariably utilizing the 2D inconsistent semantics from CLIP, CSE leverages the
3D consistent semantics generated from the well-trained semantic field itself
for semantic field training, aiming to reduce ambiguity and enhance overall
semantic consistency across different views. Extensive experiments validate our

Addressing the issue of slow training and rendering associated with large

substantial number of images, requiring extensive resources such as
high-performance GPUs. (3) Overcoming significant artifacts and low visual
fidelity commonly observed in large-scale reconstruction tasks due to limited

decomposition algorithm that decomposes a large aerial image set into multiple
small sets with appropriately sized overlaps, allowing us to train individual
NeRFs of sub-scene. This decomposition approach not only decouples rendering
time from the scene size but also enables rendering to scale seamlessly to
arbitrarily large environments. Moreover, it allows for per-block updates of
the environment, enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the

Radiance Fields, have demonstrated significant capabilities for reconstructing
surfaces with complicated geometry and topology, and generating novel views of
a scene. Nevertheless, it is challenging for users to directly deform or
manipulate these implicit representations with large deformations in the
real-time fashion. Gaussian Splatting(GS) has recently become a promising
method with explicit geometry for representing static scenes and facilitating
high-quality and real-time synthesis of novel views. However,it cannot be
easily deformed due to the use of discrete Gaussians and lack of explicit
topology. To address this, we develop a novel GS-based method that enables
interactive deformation. Our key idea is to design an innovative mesh-based GS
representation, which is integrated into Gaussian learning and manipulation. 3D
Gaussians are defined over an explicit mesh, and they are bound with each
other: the rendering of 3D Gaussians guides the mesh face split for adaptive
refinement, and the mesh face split directs the splitting of 3D Gaussians.
Moreover, the explicit mesh constraints help regularize the Gaussian
distribution, suppressing poor-quality Gaussians(e.g. misaligned
Gaussians,long-narrow shaped Gaussians), thus enhancing visual quality and
avoiding artifacts during deformation. Based on this representation, we further
introduce a large-scale Gaussian deformation technique to enable deformable GS,
which alters the parameters of 3D Gaussians according to the manipulation of
the associated mesh. Our method benefits from existing mesh deformation
datasets for more realistic data-driven Gaussian deformation. Extensive
experiments show that our approach achieves high-quality reconstruction and

Recent neural approaches have accomplished exceptional NVS results for static

real-time and photo-realistic renderings. This technique typically takes
perspective images as input and optimizes a set of 3D elliptical Gaussians by
splatting them onto the image planes, resulting in 2D Gaussians. However,
applying 3D-GS to panoramic inputs presents challenges in effectively modeling
the projection onto the spherical surface of ${360^\circ}$ images using 2D
Gaussians. In practical applications, input panoramas are often sparse, leading
to unreliable initialization of 3D Gaussians and subsequent degradation of
3D-GS quality. In addition, due to the under-constrained geometry of
texture-less planes (e.g., walls and floors), 3D-GS struggles to model these
flat regions with elliptical Gaussians, resulting in significant floaters in
novel views. To address these issues, we propose 360-GS, a novel $360^{\circ}$
Gaussian splatting for a limited set of panoramic inputs. Instead of splatting
3D Gaussians directly onto the spherical surface, 360-GS projects them onto the
tangent plane of the unit sphere and then maps them to the spherical
projections. This adaptation enables the representation of the projection using
Gaussians. We guide the optimization of 360-GS by exploiting layout priors
within panoramas, which are simple to obtain and contain strong structural
information about the indoor scene. Our experimental results demonstrate that
360-GS allows panoramic rendering and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
fewer artifacts in novel view synthesis, thus providing immersive roaming in
indoor scenarios.";Jiayang Bai<author:sep>Letian Huang<author:sep>Jie Guo<author:sep>Wen Gong<author:sep>Yuanqi Li<author:sep>Yanwen Guo;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00763v1;cs.CV;11 pages, 10 figures;gaussian splatting

regularization, we leverage the depth information derived from NeRF to
establish image correspondences between different views. For learned
regularization, we align the latent codes in the 2D diffusion model between
edited and unedited images, enabling us to edit key views and propagate the
update throughout the entire scene. Incorporating these two strategies, our
ViCA-NeRF operates in two stages. In the initial stage, we blend edits from
different views to create a preliminary 3D edit. This is followed by a second
stage of NeRF training, dedicated to further refining the scene's appearance.

in many downstream surgical applications. However, existing methods suffer from
slow inference speed, which greatly limits their practical use. In this paper,
we introduce EndoGaussian, a real-time surgical scene reconstruction framework
that builds on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework represents dynamic surgical
scenes as canonical Gaussians and a time-dependent deformation field, which
predicts Gaussian deformations at novel timestamps. Due to the efficient
Gaussian representation and parallel rendering pipeline, our framework
significantly accelerates the rendering speed compared to previous methods. In
addition, we design the deformation field as the combination of a lightweight
encoding voxel and an extremely tiny MLP, allowing for efficient Gaussian
tracking with a minor rendering burden. Furthermore, we design a holistic
Gaussian initialization method to fully leverage the surface distribution
prior, achieved by searching informative points from across the input image
sequence. Experiments on public endoscope datasets demonstrate that our method
can achieve real-time rendering speed (195 FPS real-time, 100$\times$ gain)
while maintaining the state-of-the-art reconstruction quality (35.925 PSNR) and

caused by inherent bias in the depth prior. Furthermore, we draw inspiration
from notable variations in semantic consistency observed across images of
different resolutions and propose Hierarchical Semantic Guidance (HSG) to learn
the coarse-to-fine semantic content, which corresponds to the coarse-to-fine

NeRF reconstructions of 3D scenes. Based on a user-provided textual description
and a 2D bounding box in a reference viewpoint, InseRF generates new objects in
3D scenes. Recently, methods for 3D scene editing have been profoundly
transformed, owing to the use of strong priors of text-to-image diffusion
models in 3D generative modeling. Existing methods are mostly effective in
editing 3D scenes via style and appearance changes or removing existing
objects. Generating new objects, however, remains a challenge for such methods,
which we address in this study. Specifically, we propose grounding the 3D
object insertion to a 2D object insertion in a reference view of the scene. The
2D edit is then lifted to 3D using a single-view object reconstruction method.
The reconstructed object is then inserted into the scene, guided by the priors
of monocular depth estimation methods. We evaluate our method on various 3D
scenes and provide an in-depth analysis of the proposed components. Our
experiments with generative insertion of objects in several 3D scenes indicate
the effectiveness of our method compared to the existing methods. InseRF is
capable of controllable and 3D-consistent object insertion without requiring
explicit 3D information as input. Please visit our project page at

Gaussian splatting approaches for image to 3D generation are often
optimization-based, requiring many computationally expensive score-distillation

generalizable for fast and smooth convergence on new observations. This allows
for efficient computation while alleviating noise patterns by reducing the

current methods focus on single-subject cases, leaving scenes of interacting
hands that involve severe inter-hand occlusions and challenging view variations
remain unsolved. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a generalizable
visibility-aware NeRF (VA-NeRF) framework for interacting hands. Specifically,
given an image of interacting hands as input, our VA-NeRF first obtains a
mesh-based representation of hands and extracts their corresponding geometric
and textural features. Subsequently, a feature fusion module that exploits the
visibility of query points and mesh vertices is introduced to adaptively merge
features of both hands, enabling the recovery of features in unseen areas.
Additionally, our VA-NeRF is optimized together with a novel discriminator
within an adversarial learning paradigm. In contrast to conventional
discriminators that predict a single real/fake label for the synthesized image,
the proposed discriminator generates a pixel-wise visibility map, providing
fine-grained supervision for unseen areas and encouraging the VA-NeRF to

lengthy rendering time. Lately 3D Gaussians splatting-based approach has been
proposed to model the 3D scene, and it achieves remarkable visual quality while
rendering the images in real-time. However, it suffers from severe degradation

LangSplat, which constructs a 3D language field that enables precise and
efficient open-vocabulary querying within 3D spaces. Unlike existing methods
that ground CLIP language embeddings in a NeRF model, LangSplat advances the
field by utilizing a collection of 3D Gaussians, each encoding language
features distilled from CLIP, to represent the language field. By employing a
tile-based splatting technique for rendering language features, we circumvent
the costly rendering process inherent in NeRF. Instead of directly learning
CLIP embeddings, LangSplat first trains a scene-wise language autoencoder and
then learns language features on the scene-specific latent space, thereby
alleviating substantial memory demands imposed by explicit modeling. Existing
methods struggle with imprecise and vague 3D language fields, which fail to
discern clear boundaries between objects. We delve into this issue and propose
to learn hierarchical semantics using SAM, thereby eliminating the need for
extensively querying the language field across various scales and the
regularization of DINO features. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary 3D

properties is often expensive both in terms of memory and computation. If we do
path tracing and use a high dynamic range lighting environment, the rendering

for representing and rendering the appearance of heterogeneous translucent

conventional BSSRDF models assume a planar half-space medium and only surface
variation of the material, which is often not a good representation of the
appearance of real-world objects. Our method represents the BSSRDF of a full
object taking its geometry and heterogeneities into account. This is similar to
a neural radiance field, but our representation works for an arbitrary distant
lighting environment. In a sense, we present a version of neural precomputed
radiance transfer that captures all-frequency relighting of heterogeneous
translucent objects. We use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with skip
connections to represent the appearance of an object as a function of spatial
position, direction of observation, and direction of incidence. The latter is
considered a directional light incident across the entire non-self-shadowed
part of the object. We demonstrate the ability of our method to store highly
complex materials while having high accuracy when comparing to reference images

the resource-intensive nature of collecting 3D human pose data. As a result,
pose estimators trained on public datasets significantly underperform when
applied to unseen out-of-distribution samples. Previous works proposed
augmenting public datasets by generating 2D-3D pose pairs or rendering a large
amount of random data. Such approaches either overlook image rendering or
result in suboptimal datasets for pre-trained models. Here we propose PoseGen,
which learns to generate a dataset (human 3D poses and images) with a feedback
loss from a given pre-trained pose estimator. In contrast to prior art, our
generated data is optimized to improve the robustness of the pre-trained model.
The objective of PoseGen is to learn a distribution of data that maximizes the

contains OOD samples of the pre-trained model, sampling data from such a
distribution for further fine-tuning a pre-trained model improves the
generalizability of the model. This is the first work that proposes NeRFs for

diffusion models to generate multi-view images, followed by NeRF
reconstruction. Yet, existing supervised finetuned (SFT) diffusion models still
suffer from multi-view inconsistency and the resulting NeRF artifacts. Although
training longer with SFT improves consistency, it also causes distribution
shift, which reduces diversity and realistic details. We argue that the SFT of
multi-view diffusion models resembles the instruction finetuning stage of the
LLM alignment pipeline and can benefit from RL finetuning (RLFT) methods.
Essentially, RLFT methods optimize models beyond their SFT data distribution by
using their own outputs, effectively mitigating distribution shift. To this
end, we introduce Carve3D, a RLFT method coupled with the Multi-view
Reconstruction Consistency (MRC) metric, to improve the consistency of
multi-view diffusion models. To compute MRC on a set of multi-view images, we
compare them with their corresponding renderings of the reconstructed NeRF at
the same viewpoints. We validate the robustness of MRC with extensive
experiments conducted under controlled inconsistency levels. We enhance the
base RLFT algorithm to stabilize the training process, reduce distribution
shift, and identify scaling laws. Through qualitative and quantitative
experiments, along with a user study, we demonstrate Carve3D's improved

Neural radiance fields, particularly NeRF, initially developed for static

However, the challenge for video view synthesis arises from motion blur, a
consequence of object or camera movement during exposure, which hinders the
precise synthesis of sharp spatio-temporal views. In response, we propose a
novel dynamic deblurring NeRF framework for blurry monocular video, called
DyBluRF, consisting of an Interleave Ray Refinement (IRR) stage and a Motion

addresses and handles the novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video. The
IRR stage jointly reconstructs dynamic 3D scenes and refines the inaccurate
camera pose information to combat imprecise pose information extracted from the
given blurry frames. The MDD stage is a novel incremental latent sharp-rays

the latent sharp rays into global camera motion and local object motion

NeRF-based encoding of color and opacity. Our model uses Gaussian distributions
with trainable positions (i.e. means of Gaussian), shape (i.e. covariance of

novel view images of a 3D scene. It includes density and color fields to model
the shape and radiance of a scene, respectively. Supervised by the photometric
loss in an end-to-end training manner, NeRF inherently suffers from the
shape-radiance ambiguity problem, i.e., it can perfectly fit training views but
does not guarantee decoupling the two fields correctly. To deal with this
issue, existing works have incorporated prior knowledge to provide an
independent supervision signal for the density field, including total variation
loss, sparsity loss, distortion loss, etc. These losses are based on general
assumptions about the density field, e.g., it should be smooth, sparse, or
compact, which are not adaptive to a specific scene. In this paper, we propose
a more adaptive method to reduce the shape-radiance ambiguity. The key is a
rendering method that is only based on the density field. Specifically, we
first estimate the color field based on the density field and posed images in a
closed form. Then NeRF's rendering process can proceed. We address the problems
in estimating the color field, including occlusion and non-uniformly
distributed views. Afterward, it is applied to regularize NeRF's density field.
As our regularization is guided by photometric loss, it is more adaptive
compared to existing ones. Experimental results show that our method improves

of producing evermore photo-realistic results. 3D Gaussian Splatting has
emerged as a particularly promising method, producing high-quality renderings
of static scenes and enabling interactive viewing at real-time frame rates.
However, it is currently limited to static scenes only. In this work, we extend
3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct dynamic scenes. We model the dynamics of a
scene using a tunable MLP, which learns the deformation field from a canonical
space to a set of 3D Gaussians per frame. To disentangle the static and dynamic
parts of the scene, we learn a tuneable parameter for each Gaussian, which
weighs the respective MLP parameters to focus attention on the dynamic parts.
This improves the model's ability to capture dynamics in scenes with an
imbalance of static to dynamic regions. To handle scenes of arbitrary length
whilst maintaining high rendering quality, we introduce an adaptive window
sampling strategy to partition the sequence into windows based on the amount of
movement in the sequence. We train a separate dynamic Gaussian Splatting model
for each window, allowing the canonical representation to change, thus enabling
the reconstruction of scenes with significant geometric or topological changes.
Temporal consistency is enforced using a fine-tuning step with self-supervising
consistency loss on randomly sampled novel views. As a result, our method

high-resolution novel views with low-resolution training data. To solve this
problem, we propose a zero-shot super-resolution training framework for NeRF.
This framework aims to guide the NeRF model to synthesize high-resolution novel
views via single-scene internal learning rather than requiring any external
high-resolution training data. Our approach consists of two stages. First, we
learn a scene-specific degradation mapping by performing internal learning on a
pretrained low-resolution coarse NeRF. Second, we optimize a super-resolution
fine NeRF by conducting inverse rendering with our mapping function so as to
backpropagate the gradients from low-resolution 2D space into the
super-resolution 3D sampling space. Then, we further introduce a temporal
ensemble strategy in the inference phase to compensate for the scene estimation
errors. Our method is featured on two points: (1) it does not consume
high-resolution views or additional scene data to train super-resolution NeRF;
(2) it can speed up the training process by adopting a coarse-to-fine strategy.

for modeling of static 3D scenes. In contrast to Neural Radiance Fields, it
utilizes efficient rasterization allowing for very fast rendering at
high-quality. However, the storage size is significantly higher, which hinders
practical deployment, e.g.~on resource constrained devices. In this paper, we
introduce a compact scene representation organizing the parameters of 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into a 2D grid with local homogeneity, ensuring a
drastic reduction in storage requirements without compromising visual quality
during rendering. Central to our idea is the explicit exploitation of
perceptual redundancies present in natural scenes. In essence, the inherent
nature of a scene allows for numerous permutations of Gaussian parameters to
equivalently represent it. To this end, we propose a novel highly parallel
algorithm that regularly arranges the high-dimensional Gaussian parameters into
a 2D grid while preserving their neighborhood structure. During training, we
further enforce local smoothness between the sorted parameters in the grid. The
uncompressed Gaussians use the same structure as 3DGS, ensuring a seamless
integration with established renderers. Our method achieves a reduction factor
of 8x to 26x in size for complex scenes with no increase in training time,
marking a substantial leap forward in the domain of 3D scene distribution and

flexibility and efficiency) imposed by mesh or NeRF-based representations.
However, a naive application of Gaussian splatting cannot generate high-quality
animatable avatars and suffers from learning instability; it also cannot
capture fine avatar geometries and often leads to degenerate body parts. To
tackle these problems, we first propose a primitive-based 3D Gaussian
representation where Gaussians are defined inside pose-driven primitives to
facilitate animation. Second, to stabilize and amortize the learning of
millions of Gaussians, we propose to use neural implicit fields to predict the
Gaussian attributes (e.g., colors). Finally, to capture fine avatar geometries

correspondence between various face representations for motion transfer. Recent

representation, which further enhanced the performance of multi-view face
reenactment in photo-realism and 3D consistency. However, establishing dense
correspondence between different face NeRFs is non-trivial, because implicit
representations lack ground-truth correspondence annotations like mesh-based 3D
parametric models (e.g., 3DMM) with index-aligned vertexes. Although aligning
3DMM space with NeRF-based face representations can realize motion control, it

Therefore, we are inspired to ask: Can we learn the dense correspondence

tri-planes as fundamental NeRF representation and decomposes face tri-planes
into three components: canonical tri-planes, identity deformations, and motion.
In terms of motion control, our key contribution is proposing a Plane

by the evolution of generative models. Prominent among these are methods based
on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and the adaptation of diffusion models in
the 3D domain. Despite their progress, these techniques often face limitations
due to slow optimization or rendering processes, leading to extensive training
and optimization times. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for
single-view reconstruction that efficiently generates a 3D model from a single
image via feed-forward inference. Our method utilizes two transformer-based
networks, namely a point decoder and a triplane decoder, to reconstruct 3D
objects using a hybrid Triplane-Gaussian intermediate representation. This
hybrid representation strikes a balance, achieving a faster rendering speed
compared to implicit representations while simultaneously delivering superior
rendering quality than explicit representations. The point decoder is designed
for generating point clouds from single images, offering an explicit
representation which is then utilized by the triplane decoder to query Gaussian
features for each point. This design choice addresses the challenges associated
with directly regressing explicit 3D Gaussian attributes characterized by their
non-structural nature. Subsequently, the 3D Gaussians are decoded by an MLP to
enable rapid rendering through splatting. Both decoders are built upon a
scalable, transformer-based architecture and have been efficiently trained on

target view given source view images and their corresponding poses, is a
fundamental problem in 3D Vision. As this task is heavily under-constrained,
some recent work, like Zero123, tries to solve this problem with generative
modeling, specifically using pre-trained diffusion models. Although this
strategy generalizes well to new scenes, compared to neural radiance
field-based methods, it offers low levels of flexibility. For example, it can
only accept a single-view image as input, despite realistic applications often
offering multiple input images. This is because the source-view images and
corresponding poses are processed separately and injected into the model at
different stages. Thus it is not trivial to generalize the model into
multi-view source images, once they are available. To solve this issue, we try
to process each pose image pair separately and then fuse them as a unified
visual representation which will be injected into the model to guide image
synthesis at the target-views. However, inconsistency and computation costs
increase as the number of input source-view images increases. To solve these
issues, the Multi-view Cross Former module is proposed which maps
variable-length input data to fix-size output data. A two-stage training

fine-tuning large text2image diffusion models on synthetic multi-view data.
Despite robust zero-shot generalization, they may need post-processing and can
face quality issues due to the synthetic-real domain gap. This paper introduces
a novel pipeline for unsupervised training of a pose-conditioned diffusion
model on single-category datasets. With the help of pretrained self-supervised
Vision Transformers (DINOv2), we identify object poses by clustering the
dataset through comparing visibility and locations of specific object parts.
The pose-conditioned diffusion model, trained on pose labels, and equipped with
cross-frame attention at inference time ensures cross-view consistency, that is
further aided by our novel hard-attention guidance. Our model, MIRAGE,
surpasses prior work in novel view synthesis on real images. Furthermore,
MIRAGE is robust to diverse textures and geometries, as demonstrated with our

correspondences in images and 3D correspondences on object surfaces. Is there
another kind, and if there is, what can they do for us? In this paper, we
introduce correspondences of the third kind we call reflection correspondences

correspondences in the reflected world, i.e., the scene reflected by the object

radiometrically, respectively, causing incorrect pixel correspondences.
Geometry recovered from each image is also hampered by distortions, namely
generalized bas-relief ambiguity, leading to erroneous 3D correspondences. We
show that reflection correspondences can resolve the ambiguities arising from
these distortions. We introduce a neural correspondence estimator and a RANSAC

Methods that use Neural Radiance fields are versatile for traditional tasks
such as novel view synthesis. In recent times, some work has emerged that aims
to extend the functionality of NeRF beyond view synthesis, for semantically
aware tasks such as editing and segmentation using 3D feature field
distillation from 2D foundation models. However, these methods have two major
limitations: (a) they are limited by the rendering speed of NeRF pipelines, and
(b) implicitly represented feature fields suffer from continuity artifacts
reducing feature quality. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown
state-of-the-art performance on real-time radiance field rendering. In this
work, we go one step further: in addition to radiance field rendering, we
enable 3D Gaussian splatting on arbitrary-dimension semantic features via 2D
foundation model distillation. This translation is not straightforward: naively
incorporating feature fields in the 3DGS framework leads to warp-level
divergence. We propose architectural and training changes to efficiently avert
this problem. Our proposed method is general, and our experiments showcase
novel view semantic segmentation, language-guided editing and segment anything

real-world objects can be modeled more efficiently with surfaces instead of
volumes, requiring far fewer samples per ray. This observation has spurred
considerable progress in surface representations such as signed distance
functions, but these may struggle to model semi-opaque and thin structures. We
propose a method, HybridNeRF, that leverages the strengths of both
representations by rendering most objects as surfaces while modeling the
(typically) small fraction of challenging regions volumetrically. We evaluate
HybridNeRF against the challenging Eyeful Tower dataset along with other

scene represented by the neural radiance fields (NeRFs). Given an arbitrary
view and two sets of scene images captured at different timestamps, we can
predict the scene changes in that view, which has significant potential
applications in scene monitoring and measuring. We conducted preliminary
studies and found that such an exciting task cannot be easily achieved by
utilizing existing NeRFs and 2D change detection methods with many false or
missing detections. The main reason is that the 2D change detection is based on
the pixel appearance difference between spatial-aligned image pairs and
neglects the stereo information in the NeRF. To address the limitations, we
propose the C-NERF to represent scene changes as directional consistency
difference-based NeRF, which mainly contains three modules. We first perform
the spatial alignment of two NeRFs captured before and after changes. Then, we
identify the change points based on the direction-consistent constraint; that
is, real change points have similar change representations across view
directions, but fake change points do not. Finally, we design the change map
rendering process based on the built NeRFs and can generate the change map of
an arbitrarily specified view direction. To validate the effectiveness, we
build a new dataset containing ten scenes covering diverse scenarios with

computer vision and graphics. Recently, Gaussian splatting has emerged as a
robust technique to represent static scenes and enable high-quality and
real-time novel view synthesis. Building upon this technique, we propose a new
representation that explicitly decomposes the motion and appearance of dynamic
scenes into sparse control points and dense Gaussians, respectively. Our key
idea is to use sparse control points, significantly fewer in number than the
Gaussians, to learn compact 6 DoF transformation bases, which can be locally
interpolated through learned interpolation weights to yield the motion field of
3D Gaussians. We employ a deformation MLP to predict time-varying 6 DoF
transformations for each control point, which reduces learning complexities,
enhances learning abilities, and facilitates obtaining temporal and spatial
coherent motion patterns. Then, we jointly learn the 3D Gaussians, the
canonical space locations of control points, and the deformation MLP to
reconstruct the appearance, geometry, and dynamics of 3D scenes. During
learning, the location and number of control points are adaptively adjusted to
accommodate varying motion complexities in different regions, and an ARAP loss
following the principle of as rigid as possible is developed to enforce spatial
continuity and local rigidity of learned motions. Finally, thanks to the
explicit sparse motion representation and its decomposition from appearance,
our method can enable user-controlled motion editing while retaining
high-fidelity appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing approaches on novel view synthesis with a high rendering

devices remains challenging, due to data storage and computational constraints.
In this paper, we introduce VideoRF, the first approach to enable real-time
streaming and rendering of dynamic radiance fields on mobile platforms. At the
core is a serialized 2D feature image stream representing the 4D radiance field
all in one. We introduce a tailored training scheme directly applied to this 2D
domain to impose the temporal and spatial redundancy of the feature image
stream. By leveraging the redundancy, we show that the feature image stream can
be efficiently compressed by 2D video codecs, which allows us to exploit video
hardware accelerators to achieve real-time decoding. On the other hand, based
on the feature image stream, we propose a novel rendering pipeline for VideoRF,
which has specialized space mappings to query radiance properties efficiently.
Paired with a deferred shading model, VideoRF has the capability of real-time

compress a Hash Map containing only non-zero coefficients and their locations

of visual computing applications that involves representing a 3D scene as a
model that is trained from 2D images using gradient descent. Recent works (e.g.
3D Gaussian Splatting) use a rasterization pipeline to enable rendering high

These methods have been demonstrated to be very promising, providing
state-of-art quality for many important tasks. However, training a model to
represent a scene is still a time-consuming task even when using powerful GPUs.
In this work, we observe that the gradient computation phase during training is
a significant bottleneck on GPUs due to the large number of atomic operations
that need to be processed. These atomic operations overwhelm atomic units in
the L2 partitions causing stalls. To address this challenge, we leverage the
observations that during the gradient computation: (1) for most warps, all
threads atomically update the same memory locations; and (2) warps generate
varying amounts of atomic traffic (since some threads may be inactive). We
propose DISTWAR, a software-approach to accelerate atomic operations based on
two key ideas: First, we enable warp-level reduction of threads at the SM
sub-cores using registers to leverage the locality in intra-warp atomic
updates. Second, we distribute the atomic computation between the warp-level
reduction at the SM and the L2 atomic units to increase the throughput of
atomic computation. Warps with many threads performing atomic updates to the
same memory locations are scheduled at the SM, and the rest using L2 atomic

that it can generate dense point clouds with detailed structure. Nonetheless, a
naive adoption of 3D Gaussian Splatting can fail since the generated points are

MD-Splatting builds on recent advances in Gaussian splatting, a method that

We argue that the per-point motions of a dynamic scene can be decomposed into a
small set of explicit or learned trajectories. Our carefully designed neural
framework consisting of a tiny set of learned basis queried only in time allows
for rendering speed similar to 3D Gaussian Splatting, surpassing 120 FPS, while
at the same time, requiring only double the storage compared to static scenes.
Our neural representation adequately constrains the inherently underconstrained
motion field of a dynamic scene leading to effective and fast optimization.
This is done by biding each point to motion coefficients that enforce the
per-point sharing of basis trajectories. By carefully applying a sparsity loss
to the motion coefficients, we are able to disentangle the motions that
comprise the scene, independently control them, and generate novel motion
combinations that have never been seen before. We can reach state-of-the-art

  To address this challenge, we introduce LightGaussian, a novel method

Drawing inspiration from the concept of Network Pruning, LightGaussian
identifies Gaussians that are insignificant in contributing to the scene

LightGaussian employs distillation and pseudo-view augmentation to distill
spherical harmonics to a lower degree, allowing knowledge transfer to more

challenging task, particularly illumination/albedo ambiguities and occlusion of
the illumination environment (shadowing) caused by geometry. However, there are
many cues in an image that can aid in the disentanglement of geometry, albedo

measurement of distant lighting in the corresponding direction and, via a
neural illumination prior, a statistical cue as to the remaining illumination
environment. We also introduce a novel `outside-in' method for computing
differentiable sky visibility based on a neural directional distance function.
This is efficient and can be trained in parallel with the neural scene

illumination from multi-view images captured under unknown lighting conditions.
There are two main problems when introducing GS to inverse rendering: 1) GS
does not support producing plausible normal natively; 2) forward mapping (e.g.
rasterization and splatting) cannot trace the occlusion like backward mapping
(e.g. ray tracing). To address these challenges, our GS-IR proposes an
efficient optimization scheme that incorporates a depth-derivation-based
regularization for normal estimation and a baking-based occlusion to model

We propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to represent 3D human face and

scene geometry and improve the mapping of previously observed areas. This
strategy is essential to extend 3D Gaussian representation to reconstruct the
whole scene rather than synthesize a static object in existing methods.
Moreover, in the pose tracking process, an effective coarse-to-fine technique

representation is becoming increasingly popular. Most existing methods treat
semantic prediction as an additional rendering task, \textit{i.e.}, the ""label
rendering"" task, to build semantic NeRFs. However, by rendering
semantic/instance labels per pixel without considering the contextual
information of the rendered image, these methods usually suffer from unclear
boundary segmentation and abnormal segmentation of pixels within an object. To
solve this problem, we propose Generalized Perception NeRF (GP-NeRF), a novel
pipeline that makes the widely used segmentation model and NeRF work compatibly
under a unified framework, for facilitating context-aware 3D scene perception.
To accomplish this goal, we introduce transformers to aggregate radiance as
well as semantic embedding fields jointly for novel views and facilitate the
joint volumetric rendering of both fields. In addition, we propose two
self-distillation mechanisms, i.e., the Semantic Distill Loss and the
Depth-Guided Semantic Distill Loss, to enhance the discrimination and quality
of the semantic field and the maintenance of geometric consistency. In
evaluation, we conduct experimental comparisons under two perception tasks

eliminating the need for scene-specific retraining in vanilla NeRF. A critical
enabling factor in these approaches is the extraction of a generalizable 3D

an Entangled View-Epipolar Information Aggregation method dubbed EVE-NeRF.
Different from existing methods that consider cross-view and along-epipolar

aggregation in an entangled manner by injecting the scene-invariant appearance
continuity and geometry consistency priors to the aggregation process. Our

in computer vision. Given a set of images taken from a freely moving camera at
train time, the proposed approach could synthesize a realistic image of the
scene from a novel viewpoint at test time. The key ideas presented in this
paper are (i) Recovering accurate camera parameters via a robust pipeline from
unposed day-to-day images is equally crucial in neural novel view synthesis
problem; (ii) It is rather more practical to model object's content at
different resolutions since dramatic camera motion is highly likely in
day-to-day unposed images. To incorporate the key ideas, we leverage the
fundamentals of scene rigidity, multi-scale neural scene representation, and
single-image depth prediction. Concretely, the proposed approach makes the
camera parameters as learnable in a neural fields-based modeling framework. By
assuming per view depth prediction is given up to scale, we constrain the
relative pose between successive frames. From the relative poses, absolute
camera pose estimation is modeled via a graph-neural network-based multiple
motion averaging within the multi-scale neural-fields network, leading to a
single loss function. Optimizing the introduced loss function provides camera
intrinsic, extrinsic, and image rendering from unposed images. We demonstrate,
with examples, that for a unified framework to accurately model multiscale
neural scene representation from day-to-day acquired unposed multi-view images,
it is equally essential to have precise camera-pose estimates within the scene
representation framework. Without considering robustness measures in the camera

considering the accumulated transmittance along each camera ray, our
Uncertainty Field infers 2D pixel-wise uncertainty, exhibiting high values for

synthesis given multi-view images. Recently, some works have attempted to train
a NeRF from a single image with 3D priors. They mainly focus on a limited field
of view with a few occlusions, which greatly limits their scalability to
real-world 360-degree panoramic scenarios with large-size occlusions. In this
paper, we present PERF, a 360-degree novel view synthesis framework that trains
a panoramic neural radiance field from a single panorama. Notably, PERF allows
3D roaming in a complex scene without expensive and tedious image collection.
To achieve this goal, we propose a novel collaborative RGBD inpainting method
and a progressive inpainting-and-erasing method to lift up a 360-degree 2D
scene to a 3D scene. Specifically, we first predict a panoramic depth map as
initialization given a single panorama and reconstruct visible 3D regions with
volume rendering. Then we introduce a collaborative RGBD inpainting approach
into a NeRF for completing RGB images and depth maps from random views, which
is derived from an RGB Stable Diffusion model and a monocular depth estimator.
Finally, we introduce an inpainting-and-erasing strategy to avoid inconsistent
geometry between a newly-sampled view and reference views. The two components
are integrated into the learning of NeRFs in a unified optimization framework
and achieve promising results. Extensive experiments on Replica and a new
dataset PERF-in-the-wild demonstrate the superiority of our PERF over
state-of-the-art methods. Our PERF can be widely used for real-world

Instant-NGP (INGP) introduced multi-resolution hash encoding from a lookup

achieve this task from only a few images by introducing a new loss function for
unknown viewpoints with no input images. The loss function assumes that a
pre-trained feature extractor should output the same feature even if input

as viewpoints continuously change, also feature vectors continuously change.
Thus, the assumption can harm training. To avoid this harmful training, we

the method provides appropriate supervision for each unknown viewpoint by the
interpolated features, the volume representation is learned better than
DietNeRF. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better

typically using deformation fields. The existing dynamic NeRFs employ a similar
Eulerian representation for both light radiance and deformation fields. This
leads to a close coupling of appearance and motion and lacks a physical
interpretation. In this work, we propose Dynamic Appearance Particle Neural
Radiance Field (DAP-NeRF), which introduces particle-based representation to
model the motions of visual elements in a dynamic 3D scene. DAP-NeRF consists
of superposition of a static field and a dynamic field. The dynamic field is
quantised as a collection of {\em appearance particles}, which carries the
visual information of a small dynamic element in the scene and is equipped with
a motion model. All components, including the static field, the visual features
and motion models of the particles, are learned from monocular videos without
any prior geometric knowledge of the scene. We develop an efficient

Unlike coordinate-based neural radiance fields in need of sufficient views of
one scene, our model is applicable to single or few inputs and performs well on
images from unseen scenes. To enable generalization across scenes, we propose
to use reprojection supervision to induce the predicted MPI to learn the
correct geometry between the 3D coordinates and the images. Moreover, we remove
the stringent requirement of dense depth supervision from deep
multiview-stereo-based methods by introducing rendering techniques of radiance
fields. rpcPRF combines the superiority of implicit representations and the
advantages of the RPC model, to capture the continuous altitude space while
learning the 3D structure. Given an RGB image and its corresponding RPC, the
end-to-end model learns to synthesize the novel view with a new RPC and
reconstruct the altitude of the scene. When multiple views are provided as
inputs, rpcPRF exerts extra supervision provided by the extra views. On the TLC

significant potential for representing 3D scene appearances as implicit neural
networks, enabling the synthesis of high-fidelity novel views. However, the
lengthy training and rendering process hinders the widespread adoption of this
promising technique for real-time rendering applications. To address this
issue, we present an effective adaptive multi-NeRF method designed to
accelerate the neural rendering process for large scenes with unbalanced
workloads due to varying scene complexities.
  Our method adaptively subdivides scenes into axis-aligned bounding boxes
using a tree hierarchy approach, assigning smaller NeRFs to different-sized
subspaces based on the complexity of each scene portion. This ensures the
underlying neural representation is specific to a particular part of the scene.
We optimize scene subdivision by employing a guidance density grid, which
balances representation capability for each Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).
Consequently, samples generated by each ray can be sorted and collected for
parallel inference, achieving a balanced workload suitable for small MLPs with
consistent dimensions for regular and GPU-friendly computations. We aosl
demonstrated an efficient NeRF sampling strategy that intrinsically adapts to
increase parallelism, utilization, and reduce kernel calls, thereby achieving
much higher GPU utilization and accelerating the rendering process.";Tong Wang<author:sep>Shuichi Kurabayashi;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01881v1;cs.CV;;nerf

point-level scene representations. Sensor data can be utilized more efficiently
by leveraging the segment-level representation capabilities of child NeRFs, and
an approximate volumetric representation of the scene can be quickly obtained

requirement for only posed RGB inputs. Previous NeRF-based view planning
methods exhibit computational inefficiency since they rely on an iterative
paradigm, consisting of (1) retraining the NeRF when new images arrive; and (2)
planning a path to the next best view only. To address these limitations, we
propose a non-iterative pipeline based on the Prediction of the Required number
of Views (PRV). The key idea behind our approach is that the required number of
views to reconstruct an object depends on its complexity. Therefore, we design
a deep neural network, named PRVNet, to predict the required number of views,
allowing us to tailor the data acquisition based on the object complexity and
plan a globally shortest path. To train our PRVNet, we generate supervision
labels using the ShapeNet dataset. Simulated experiments show that our

Specifically, we introduce a location-specific sampling technique as well as a
multi-camera tiling (MCT) strategy to reduce memory consumption during image

convergence rate within tiles. MCT decomposes a large-frame image into multiple
tiled images with different camera models, allowing these small-frame images to
be fed into the training process as needed for specific locations without a

Mip-NeRF, and compare its geometry performance with threephotgrammetric MVS

on multi-plane images (MPI), for high-quality view synthesis of complex scenes.
MPI with Normalized Device Coordinate (NDC) parameterization is widely used in
NeRF learning for its simple definition, easy calculation, and powerful ability
to represent unbounded scenes. However, existing NeRF works that adopt MPI
representation for novel view synthesis can only handle simple forward-facing
unbounded scenes, where the input cameras are all observing in similar
directions with small relative translations. Hence, extending these MPI-based
methods to more complex scenes like large-range or even 360-degree scenes is
very challenging. In this paper, we explore the potential of MPI and show that
MPI can synthesize high-quality novel views of complex scenes with diverse
camera distributions and view directions, which are not only limited to simple
forward-facing scenes. Our key idea is to encode the neural radiance field with
multiple MPIs facing different directions and blend them with an adaptive
blending operation. For each region of the scene, the blending operation gives
larger blending weights to those advantaged MPIs with stronger local
representation abilities while giving lower weights to those with weaker
representation abilities. Such blending operation automatically modulates the
multiple MPIs to appropriately represent the diverse local density and color
information. Experiments on the KITTI dataset and ScanNet dataset demonstrate
that our proposed MMPI synthesizes high-quality images from diverse camera pose
distributions and is fast to train, outperforming the previous fast-training
NeRF methods for novel view synthesis. Moreover, we show that MMPI can encode

a static NeRF to represent the canonical space, and render dynamic images at
other time steps by mapping the sampled 3D points back to the canonical space
with the learned backward flow field. However, this backward flow field is
non-smooth and discontinuous, which is difficult to be fitted by commonly used
smooth motion models. To address this problem, we propose to estimate the
forward flow field and directly warp the canonical radiance field to other time
steps. Such forward flow field is smooth and continuous within the object

represent the canonical radiance field with voxel grids to enable efficient
forward warping, and propose a differentiable warping process, including an
average splatting operation and an inpaint network, to resolve the many-to-one

NeRF network configuration and hyperparameter. As a result, the direct usage of
density values, e.g. via filtering with global density thresholds, usually
requires empirical investigations. Under the assumption that the density
increases from non-object to object area, the utilization of density gradients
from relative values is evident. As the density represents a position-dependent

voxelized 3D density field is justified. In this regard, we address geometric
3D reconstructions based on density gradients, whereas the gradients result
from 3D edge detection filters of the first and second derivatives, namely
Sobel, Canny and Laplacian of Gaussian. The gradients rely on relative
neighboring density values in all directions, thus are independent from
absolute magnitudes. Consequently, gradient filters are able to extract edges

causes the same object in supervision to show various states (color tone,

multimodal guidance into a unified space to keep the multimodal styles

However, they struggle to capture complex surfaces with high-frequency

Building on this insight, we generate avatars with a compositional model, in

choice in terms of representation efficacy since different parts of the human

not suitable for modeling clothing and hair. Motivated by this, we present
Disentangled Avatars~(DELTA), which models humans with hybrid explicit-implicit
3D representations. DELTA takes a monocular RGB video as input, and produces a
human avatar with separate body and clothing/hair layers. Specifically, we
demonstrate two important applications for DELTA. For the first one, we
consider the disentanglement of the human body and clothing and in the second,

editing. However, editing 3D scenes is still in its early stages. It poses
various challenges, such as the requirement to design specific methods for
different editing types, retraining new models for various 3D scenes, and the
absence of convenient human interaction during editing. To tackle these issues,
we introduce a text-driven editing method, termed DN2N, which allows for the
direct acquisition of a NeRF model with universal editing capabilities,
eliminating the requirement for retraining. Our method employs off-the-shelf
text-based editing models of 2D images to modify the 3D scene images, followed
by a filtering process to discard poorly edited images that disrupt 3D
consistency. We then consider the remaining inconsistency as a problem of
removing noise perturbation, which can be solved by generating training data
with similar perturbation characteristics for training. We further propose
cross-view regularization terms to help the generalized NeRF model mitigate
these perturbations. Our text-driven method allows users to edit a 3D scene
with their desired description, which is more friendly, intuitive, and
practical than prior works. Empirical results show that our method achieves
multiple editing types, including but not limited to appearance editing,
weather transition, material changing, and style transfer. Most importantly,

view synthesis task has been widely explored. However, existing methods are
limited to objects and indoor scenes. In this work, we extend the
generalization task to outdoor scenes, trained only on object-level datasets.
This approach presents two challenges. Firstly, the significant distributional
shift between training and testing scenes leads to black artifacts in rendering
results. Secondly, viewpoint changes in outdoor scenes cause ghosting or
missing regions in rendered images. To address these challenges, we propose a
geometric correction module and an appearance correction module based on
multi-head attention mechanisms. We normalize rendered depth and combine it
with light direction as query in the attention mechanism. Our network
effectively corrects varying scene structures and geometric features in outdoor
scenes, generalizing well from object-level to unseen outdoor scenes.
Additionally, we use appearance correction module to correct appearance
features, preventing rendering artifacts like blank borders and ghosting due to
viewpoint changes. By combining these modules, our approach successfully
tackles the challenges of outdoor scene generalization, producing high-quality
rendering results. When evaluated on four datasets (Blender, DTU, LLFF,
Spaces), our network outperforms previous methods. Notably, compared to
MVSNeRF, our network improves average PSNR from 19.369 to 25.989, SSIM from
0.838 to 0.889, and reduces LPIPS from 0.265 to 0.224 on Spaces outdoor scenes.";Liang Song<author:sep>Guangming Wang<author:sep>Jiuming Liu<author:sep>Zhenyang Fu<author:sep>Yanzi Miao<author:sep> Hesheng;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.05028v1;cs.CV;;nerf

Going beyond existing mirror approaches for 3D human pose estimation, we
utilize mirrors for learning a complete body model, including shape and dense

involves transferring the style of an artistic domain onto a target 3D face
with stylized geometry and texture. Although fine-tuning a pre-trained 3D GAN
on the artistic domain can produce reasonable performance, this strategy has
limitations in the 3D domain. In particular, fine-tuning can deteriorate the
original GAN latent space, which affects subsequent semantic editing, and
requires independent optimization and storage for each new style, limiting
flexibility and efficient deployment. To overcome these challenges, we propose
DeformToon3D, an effective toonification framework tailored for hierarchical 3D
GAN. Our approach decomposes 3D toonification into subproblems of geometry and
texture stylization to better preserve the original latent space. Specifically,
we devise a novel StyleField that predicts conditional 3D deformation to align
a real-space NeRF to the style space for geometry stylization. Thanks to the
StyleField formulation, which already handles geometry stylization well,
texture stylization can be achieved conveniently via adaptive style mixing that
injects information of the artistic domain into the decoder of the pre-trained
3D GAN. Due to the unique design, our method enables flexible style degree

given a monocular video casually captured with hand-held camera. Our main
strategy is to construct the 3D avatar in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)

viewpoint-aware images contain identical textures on identical pixel positions
that are incomprehensible in 3D. Finally, to train NeRF with the images that

photorealistic free-view rendering of scenes. However, NeRFs require dense
sampling of images in the given scene, and their performance degrades
significantly when only a sparse set of views are available. Researchers have
found that supervising the depth estimated by the NeRF helps train it
effectively with fewer views. The depth supervision is obtained either using
classical approaches or neural networks pre-trained on a large dataset. While
the former may provide only sparse supervision, the latter may suffer from
generalization issues. As opposed to the earlier approaches, we seek to learn
the depth supervision by designing augmented models and training them along
with the NeRF. We design augmented models that encourage simpler solutions by
exploring the role of positional encoding and view-dependent radiance in
training the few-shot NeRF. The depth estimated by these simpler models is used
to supervise the NeRF depth estimates. Since the augmented models can be
inaccurate in certain regions, we design a mechanism to choose only reliable
depth estimates for supervision. Finally, we add a consistency loss between the
coarse and fine multi-layer perceptrons of the NeRF to ensure better
utilization of hierarchical sampling. We achieve state-of-the-art

Most existing works share the pipeline of training a coarse pose estimator with

challenging problem. While recent techniques employ image diffusion models for
generating plausible images at novel viewpoints or for distilling pre-trained
diffusion priors into 3D representations using score distillation sampling
(SDS), these methods often struggle to simultaneously achieve high-quality,
consistent, and detailed results for both novel-view synthesis (NVS) and
geometry. In this work, we present Sparse3D, a novel 3D reconstruction method
tailored for sparse view inputs. Our approach distills robust priors from a
multiview-consistent diffusion model to refine a neural radiance field.
Specifically, we employ a controller that harnesses epipolar features from
input views, guiding a pre-trained diffusion model, such as Stable Diffusion,
to produce novel-view images that maintain 3D consistency with the input. By
tapping into 2D priors from powerful image diffusion models, our integrated
model consistently delivers high-quality results, even when faced with
open-world objects. To address the blurriness introduced by conventional SDS,
we introduce the category-score distillation sampling (C-SDS) to enhance

advances in high-quality view synthesis. A major limitation of NeRF is its low
rendering efficiency due to the need for multiple network forwardings to render
a single pixel. Existing methods to improve NeRF either reduce the number of
required samples or optimize the implementation to accelerate the network
forwarding. Despite these efforts, the problem of multiple sampling persists
due to the intrinsic representation of radiance fields. In contrast, Neural
Light Fields (NeLF) reduce the computation cost of NeRF by querying only one
single network forwarding per pixel. To achieve a close visual quality to NeRF,
existing NeLF methods require significantly larger network capacities which
limits their rendering efficiency in practice. In this work, we propose a new
representation called Neural Radiance Distribution Field (NeRDF) that targets

similar to NeRF while preserving the rendering speed with a single network
forwarding per pixel as in NeLF. The key is to model the radiance distribution
along each ray with frequency basis and predict frequency weights using the

distributions. Experiments show that our proposed method offers a better

analyze how different camera parameterizations affect this joint optimization

To alleviate this issue, we propose MonoNeRD, a novel detection framework that
can infer dense 3D geometry and occupancy. Specifically, we model scenes with
Signed Distance Functions (SDF), facilitating the production of dense 3D
representations. We treat these representations as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and then employ volume rendering to recover RGB images and depth maps.
To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce volume
rendering for M3D, and demonstrates the potential of implicit reconstruction
for image-based 3D perception. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI-3D
benchmark and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MonoNeRD.

surface representation) typically optimize a point-wise loss and make
point-wise predictions, where one data point corresponds to one pixel.
Unfortunately, this line of research failed to use the collective supervision
of distant pixels, although it is known that pixels in an image or scene can
provide rich structural information. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to design a nonlocal multiplex training paradigm for NeRF and relevant

that processes multiple data points as a whole set instead of process multiple
inputs independently. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the unreasonable
effectiveness of S3IM in improving NeRF and neural surface representation for

ability of NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) to render novel RGB perspectives of a

an estimate of the camera pose we want to monitor, and a NeRF model containing
the scene pictured by the camera. We can then predict if the pose estimate is
within a desired distance from the ground truth and justify our prediction with
a level of confidence. VERF-Light does this by rendering a viewpoint with NeRF
at the estimated pose and estimating its relative offset to the sensor image up
to scale. Since scene scale is unknown, the approach renders another auxiliary
image and reasons over the consistency of the optical flows across the three

the discrete wavelet transform into the classical cascade MVS, which
disentangles high-frequency information explicitly. With that, disentangled
frequency features can be injected into classic NeRF via a novel hybrid neural
renderer to yield faithful high-frequency details, and an intuitive

be cast as pose estimation problems, where an X-ray projection is utilized to
reach a target in 3D space. Expanding on recent advances in the differentiable
rendering of optically reflective materials, we introduce new methods for pose
estimation of radiolucent objects using X-ray projections, and we demonstrate
the critical role of optimal view synthesis in performing this task. We first
develop an algorithm (DiffDRR) that efficiently computes Digitally
Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) and leverages automatic differentiation within
TensorFlow. Pose estimation is performed by iterative gradient descent using a
loss function that quantifies the similarity of the DRR synthesized from a
randomly initialized pose and the true fluoroscopic image at the target pose.
We propose two novel methods for high-fidelity view synthesis, Neural Tuned
Tomography (NeTT) and masked Neural Radiance Fields (mNeRF). Both methods rely
on classic Cone-Beam Computerized Tomography (CBCT); NeTT directly optimizes
the CBCT densities, while the non-zero values of mNeRF are constrained by a 3D
mask of the anatomic region segmented from CBCT. We demonstrate that both NeTT
and mNeRF distinctly improve pose estimation within our framework. By defining
a successful pose estimate to be a 3D angle error of less than 3 deg, we find
that NeTT and mNeRF can achieve similar results, both with overall success
rates more than 93%. However, the computational cost of NeTT is significantly
lower than mNeRF in both training and pose estimation. Furthermore, we show
that a NeTT trained for a single subject can generalize to synthesize
high-fidelity DRRs and ensure robust pose estimations for all other subjects.
Therefore, we suggest that NeTT is an attractive option for robust pose

non-autoregressive network to obtain context prior and improve the prediction
efficiency, and it learns a speech-animation mapping prior with better

for its efficient training and fast inference capabilities, making it a
promising direction such as virtual reality and gaming. In particular,
PlenOctree (POT)[1], an explicit hierarchical multi-scale octree

POT's fixed structure for direct optimization is sub-optimal as the scene
complexity evolves continuously with updates to cached color and density,
necessitating refining the sampling distribution to capture signal complexity
accordingly. To address this issue, we propose the dynamic PlenOctree DOT,
which adaptively refines the sample distribution to adjust to changing scene

fusion strategy during the iterative rendering process. Firstly, it identifies
the regions of interest through training signals to ensure adaptive and
efficient refinement. Next, rather than directly filtering out valueless nodes,
DOT introduces the sampling and pruning operations for octrees to aggregate

both 2D and 3D diffusion models. The core idea of Points-to-3D is to introduce
controllable sparse 3D points to guide the text-to-3D generation. Specifically,
we use the sparse point cloud generated from the 3D diffusion model, Point-E,

representation capability for photo-realistic image synthesis. Specifically, a
DNMP consists of a set of connected deformable mesh vertices with paired vertex
features to parameterize the geometry and radiance information of a local area.
To constrain the degree of freedom for optimization and lower the storage
budgets, we enforce the shape of each primitive to be decoded from a relatively
low-dimensional latent space. The rendering colors are decoded from the vertex
features (interpolated with rasterization) by a view-dependent MLP. The DNMP

plants are critical infrastructures for scientific research and industrial
processes. These facilities are complex systems that not only require regular
maintenance and upgrades but are often inaccessible to humans due to various
safety hazards. Therefore, a virtual reality (VR) system that can quickly
replicate real-world remote environments to provide users with a high level of
spatial and situational awareness is crucial for facility maintenance planning.
However, the exact 3D shapes of these facilities are often too complex to be
accurately modeled with geometric primitives through the traditional
rasterization pipeline.
  In this work, we develop Magic NeRF Lens, an interactive framework to support
facility inspection in immersive VR using neural radiance fields (NeRF) and
volumetric rendering. We introduce a novel data fusion approach that combines
the complementary strengths of volumetric rendering and geometric
rasterization, allowing a NeRF model to be merged with other conventional 3D
data, such as a computer-aided design model. We develop two novel 3D magic lens
effects to optimize NeRF rendering by exploiting the properties of human vision
and context-aware visualization. We demonstrate the high usability of our

scenes by sampling a single ray per pixel and it has demonstrated impressive
capabilities in novel-view synthesis from static scene images. However, in
practice, we usually need to recover NeRF from unconstrained image collections,
which poses two challenges: 1) the images often have dynamic changes in
appearance because of different capturing time and camera settings; 2) the
images may contain transient objects such as humans and cars, leading to
occlusion and ghosting artifacts. Conventional approaches seek to address these
challenges by locally utilizing a single ray to synthesize a color of a pixel.
In contrast, humans typically perceive appearance and objects by globally
utilizing information across multiple pixels. To mimic the perception process
of humans, in this paper, we propose Cross-Ray NeRF (CR-NeRF) that leverages
interactive information across multiple rays to synthesize occlusion-free novel
views with the same appearances as the images. Specifically, to model varying
appearances, we first propose to represent multiple rays with a novel cross-ray
feature and then recover the appearance by fusing global statistics, i.e.,
feature covariance of the rays and the image appearance. Moreover, to avoid
occlusion introduced by transient objects, we propose a transient objects
handler and introduce a grid sampling strategy for masking out the transient
objects. We theoretically find that leveraging correlation across multiple rays
promotes capturing more global information. Moreover, extensive experimental

for rendering transient NeRFs that take as input the raw, time-resolved photon

render such histograms from novel views. Different from conventional NeRFs, the
approach relies on a time-resolved version of the volume rendering equation to
render the lidar measurements and capture transient light transport phenomena

significant advances in the domain of novel view synthesis in recent years.
These models capture a volumetric radiance field of a scene, creating highly

suffer from severe ambiguities in visual data inherent to the RGB sensor, which
means that although images generated with view synthesis can visually appear
very believable, the underlying 3D model will often be wrong. This considerably

fundamental and long-standing problem in ML. Recently, multi-scale encoding
schemes (such as Space2Vec and NeRF) were proposed to directly encode any point
in 2D/3D Euclidean space as a high-dimensional vector, and has been
successfully applied to various geospatial prediction and generative tasks.
However, all current 2D and 3D location encoders are designed to model point
distances in Euclidean space. So when applied to large-scale real-world GPS
coordinate datasets, which require distance metric learning on the spherical
surface, both types of models can fail due to the map projection distortion
problem (2D) and the spherical-to-Euclidean distance approximation error (3D).
To solve these problems, we propose a multi-scale location encoder called
Sphere2Vec which can preserve spherical distances when encoding point
coordinates on a spherical surface. We developed a unified view of
distance-reserving encoding on spheres based on the DFS. We also provide
theoretical proof that the Sphere2Vec preserves the spherical surface distance
between any two points, while existing encoding schemes do not. Experiments on
20 synthetic datasets show that Sphere2Vec can outperform all baseline models
on all these datasets with up to 30.8% error rate reduction. We then apply
Sphere2Vec to three geo-aware image classification tasks - fine-grained species
recognition, Flickr image recognition, and remote sensing image classification.
Results on 7 real-world datasets show the superiority of Sphere2Vec over
multiple location encoders on all three tasks. Further analysis shows that
Sphere2Vec outperforms other location encoder models, especially in the polar

this work, we present a novel Polychromatic neural representation (Polyner) to
tackle the challenging problem of CT imaging when metallic implants exist

metal's attenuation coefficients at various energy levels of the X-ray
spectrum, leading to a nonlinear metal effect in CT measurements. Recovering CT
images from metal-affected measurements hence poses a complicated nonlinear
inverse problem where empirical models adopted in previous metal artifact
reduction (MAR) approaches lead to signal loss and strongly aliased
reconstructions. Polyner instead models the MAR problem from a nonlinear
inverse problem perspective. Specifically, we first derive a polychromatic
forward model to accurately simulate the nonlinear CT acquisition process.
Then, we incorporate our forward model into the implicit neural representation
to accomplish reconstruction. Lastly, we adopt a regularizer to preserve the
physical properties of the CT images across different energy levels while
effectively constraining the solution space. Our Polyner is an unsupervised

correspondences displayed by NeRF between reconstructed scenes and real-world
scenes offer a wide range of practical applications possibilities. Despite
significant progress in 3D reconstruction since NeRF were introduced, there
remains considerable room for exploration and experimentation. NeRF-based
models are susceptible to interference issues caused by colored ""fog"" noise.
Additionally, they frequently encounter instabilities and failures while
attempting to reconstruct unbounded scenes. Moreover, the model takes a
significant amount of time to converge, making it even more challenging to use
in such scenarios. Our approach, coined Enhance-NeRF, which adopts joint color
to balance low and high reflectivity objects display, utilizes a decoding
architecture with prior knowledge to improve recognition, and employs
multi-layer performance evaluation mechanisms to enhance learning capacity. It
achieves reconstruction of outdoor scenes within one hour under single-card
condition. Based on experimental results, Enhance-NeRF partially enhances
fitness capability and provides some support to outdoor scene reconstruction.
The Enhance-NeRF method can be used as a plug-and-play component, making it
easy to integrate with other NeRF-based models. The code is available at:

wild is their reliance on accurate camera poses. Consequently, there is growing
interest in extending NeRF models to jointly optimize camera poses and scene
representation, which offers an alternative to off-the-shelf SfM pipelines
which have well-understood failure modes. Existing approaches for unposed NeRF
operate under limited assumptions, such as a prior pose distribution or coarse
pose initialization, making them less effective in a general setting. In this
work, we propose a novel approach, LU-NeRF, that jointly estimates camera poses
and neural radiance fields with relaxed assumptions on pose configuration. Our
approach operates in a local-to-global manner, where we first optimize over
local subsets of the data, dubbed mini-scenes. LU-NeRF estimates local pose and
geometry for this challenging few-shot task. The mini-scene poses are brought
into a global reference frame through a robust pose synchronization step, where
a final global optimization of pose and scene can be performed. We show our
LU-NeRF pipeline outperforms prior attempts at unposed NeRF without making
restrictive assumptions on the pose prior. This allows us to operate in the
general SE(3) pose setting, unlike the baselines. Our results also indicate our

reconstructing 3D scenes from 2D images. Given a set of camera poses and

real-world video sequences where cameras are generally not being tracked.
Existing approaches like COLMAP and, most recently, bundle-adjusting neural

from multi-view images captured from distinct positions and perspectives. In
NeRF's rendering pipeline, neural networks are used to represent a scene
independently or transform queried learnable feature vector of a point to the
expected color or density. With the aid of geometry guides either in occupancy

reduced from hundreds to dozens in the standard volume rendering framework.
Instead of rendering yielded color after neural network evaluation, we propose
to render the queried feature vectors of a ray first and then transform the
rendered feature vector to the final pixel color by a neural network. This
fundamental change to the standard volume rendering framework requires only one
single neural network evaluation to render a pixel, which substantially lowers
the high computational complexity of the rendering framework attributed to a
large number of neural network evaluations. Consequently, we can use a

of using a neural network to describe the optical field in computer vision, we
propose a neural radio-frequency radiance field, NeRF$^\textbf{2}$, which
represents a continuous volumetric scene function that makes sense of an RF

turbo-learning, which mixes the true and synthetic datasets to intensify the

ingredient of neural surface reconstruction. We build on the successful recent
method NeuS to extend it by three new components. The first component is to
borrow the tri-plane representation from EG3D and represent signed distance
fields as a mixture of tri-planes and MLPs instead of representing it with MLPs
only. Using tri-planes leads to a more expressive data structure but will also
introduce noise in the reconstructed surface. The second component is to use a
new type of positional encoding with learnable weights to combat noise in the
reconstruction process. We divide the features in the tri-plane into multiple
frequency scales and modulate them with sin and cos functions of different
frequencies. The third component is to use learnable convolution operations on
the tri-plane features using self-attention convolution to produce features
with different frequency bands. The experiments show that PET-NeuS achieves
high-fidelity surface reconstruction on standard datasets. Following previous

reconstruction quality, we are able to improve upon the NeuS baseline by 57% on

problem in the field of digital human and metaverse. A modern talking face
generation method is expected to achieve the goals of generalized audio-lip
synchronization, good video quality, and high system efficiency. Recently,
neural radiance field (NeRF) has become a popular rendering technique in this
field since it could achieve high-fidelity and 3D-consistent talking face
generation with a few-minute-long training video. However, there still exist
several challenges for NeRF-based methods: 1) as for the lip synchronization,
it is hard to generate a long facial motion sequence of high temporal
consistency and audio-lip accuracy; 2) as for the video quality, due to the
limited data used to train the renderer, it is vulnerable to out-of-domain
input condition and produce bad rendering results occasionally; 3) as for the
system efficiency, the slow training and inference speed of the vanilla NeRF
severely obstruct its usage in real-world applications. In this paper, we
propose GeneFace++ to handle these challenges by 1) utilizing the pitch contour
as an auxiliary feature and introducing a temporal loss in the facial motion
prediction process; 2) proposing a landmark locally linear embedding method to
regulate the outliers in the predicted motion sequence to avoid robustness
issues; 3) designing a computationally efficient NeRF-based motion-to-video
renderer to achieves fast training and real-time inference. With these
settings, GeneFace++ becomes the first NeRF-based method that achieves stable

synchronization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms

synthesis by encoding neural representations of a scene. However, NeRFs require
hundreds of images per scene to synthesize photo-realistic novel views.
Training them on sparse input views leads to overfitting and incorrect scene
depth estimation resulting in artifacts in the rendered novel views. Sparse
input NeRFs were recently regularized by providing dense depth estimated from
pre-trained networks as supervision, to achieve improved performance over
sparse depth constraints. However, we find that such depth priors may be
inaccurate due to generalization issues. Instead, we hypothesize that the
visibility of pixels in different input views can be more reliably estimated to
provide dense supervision. In this regard, we compute a visibility prior
through the use of plane sweep volumes, which does not require any
pre-training. By regularizing the NeRF training with the visibility prior, we
successfully train the NeRF with few input views. We reformulate the NeRF to
also directly output the visibility of a 3D point from a given viewpoint to
reduce the training time with the visibility constraint. On multiple datasets,
our model outperforms the competing sparse input NeRF models including those

to the impressively high quality in 3D scene reconstruction and novel view
synthesis. However, image degradation caused by the scattering of atmospheric
light and object light by particles in the atmosphere can significantly
decrease the reconstruction quality when shooting scenes in hazy conditions. To
address this issue, we propose Dehazing-NeRF, a method that can recover clear
NeRF from hazy image inputs. Our method simulates the physical imaging process
of hazy images using an atmospheric scattering model, and jointly learns the
atmospheric scattering model and a clean NeRF model for both image dehazing and
novel view synthesis. Different from previous approaches, Dehazing-NeRF is an
unsupervised method with only hazy images as the input, and also does not rely
on hand-designed dehazing priors. By jointly combining the depth estimated from
the NeRF 3D scene with the atmospheric scattering model, our proposed model
breaks through the ill-posed problem of single-image dehazing while maintaining
geometric consistency. Besides, to alleviate the degradation of image quality
caused by information loss, soft margin consistency regularization, as well as
atmospheric consistency and contrast discriminative loss, are addressed during
the model training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method

evolve over time under given actions. The intuition, often termed visual
intuitive physics, is a critical ability that allows us to make effective plans
to manipulate the scene to achieve desired outcomes without relying on
extensive trial and error. In this paper, we present a framework capable of
learning 3D-grounded visual intuitive physics models from videos of complex
scenes with fluids. Our method is composed of a conditional Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-style visual frontend and a 3D point-based dynamics prediction
backend, using which we can impose strong relational and structural inductive
bias to capture the structure of the underlying environment. Unlike existing
intuitive point-based dynamics works that rely on the supervision of dense
point trajectory from simulators, we relax the requirements and only assume
access to multi-view RGB images and (imperfect) instance masks acquired using
color prior. This enables the proposed model to handle scenarios where accurate
point estimation and tracking are hard or impossible. We generate datasets
including three challenging scenarios involving fluid, granular materials, and
rigid objects in the simulation. The datasets do not include any dense particle
information so most previous 3D-based intuitive physics pipelines can barely
deal with that. We show our model can make long-horizon future predictions by

the underlying explanatory factors of 3D data, which helps AI fundamentally

challenges: (i) the 3D representations are complex and in general contains much
more information than 2D image; (ii) many 3D representations are not well
suited for gradient-based optimization, let alone disentanglement. To address
these challenges, we use NeRF as a differentiable 3D representation, and
introduce a self-supervised Navigation to identify interpretable semantic
directions in the latent space. To our best knowledge, this novel method,
dubbed NaviNeRF, is the first work to achieve fine-grained 3D disentanglement
without any priors or supervisions. Specifically, NaviNeRF is built upon the
generative NeRF pipeline, and equipped with an Outer Navigation Branch and an
Inner Refinement Branch. They are complementary -- the outer navigation is to
identify global-view semantic directions, and the inner refinement dedicates to
fine-grained attributes. A synergistic loss is further devised to coordinate
two branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NaviNeRF has a superior

downstream robotic tasks, and that modular trained exploration models
outperform other classical and end-to-end baselines. Finally, we show that

holistic shape reconstruction (HSR) of complex objects utilizing a
Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD)-based time-of-flight sensor. As
illustrated in Fig. 1, our method enables new capabilities to reconstruct
near-$360^\circ$ surrounding geometry of an object from a single scan spot. In
such a scenario, traditional line-of-sight (LOS) imaging methods only see the
front part of the object and typically fail to recover the occluded back
regions. Inspired by recent advances of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging
techniques which have demonstrated great power to reconstruct occluded objects,
Omni-LOS marries LOS and NLOS together, leveraging their complementary
advantages to jointly recover the holistic shape of the object from a single
scan position. The core of our method is to put the object nearby diffuse walls
and augment the LOS scan in the front view with the NLOS scans from the
surrounding walls, which serve as virtual ``mirrors'' to trap lights toward the
object. Instead of separately recovering the LOS and NLOS signals, we adopt an
implicit neural network to represent the object, analogous to NeRF and NeTF.
While transients are measured along straight rays in LOS but over the spherical
wavefronts in NLOS, we derive differentiable ray propagation models to
simultaneously model both types of transient measurements so that the NLOS
reconstruction also takes into account the direct LOS measurements and vice
versa. We further develop a proof-of-concept Omni-LOS hardware prototype for
real-world validation. Comprehensive experiments on various wall settings

poses from Structure from Motion, both with an enhanced variant applied through
pose refinement. Results show that the internal camera poses lead to NeRF
convergence with a PSNR of 25\,dB with a simple rotation around the x-axis and

NeRF cannot achieve satisfactory results, as it only focuses on learning
individual pixels while ignoring local information, especially at low texture

from casual videos. With the popularity of neural radiance fields (NeRF), many
works extend it to dynamic scenes with a canonical NeRF and a deformation model
that achieves 3D point transformation between the observation space and the
canonical space. Recent works rely on linear blend skinning (LBS) to achieve
the canonical-observation transformation. However, the linearly weighted
combination of rigid transformation matrices is not guaranteed to be rigid. As
a matter of fact, unexpected scale and shear factors often appear. In practice,
using LBS as the deformation model can always lead to skin-collapsing artifacts
for bending or twisting motions. To solve this problem, we propose neural dual
quaternion blend skinning (NeuDBS) to achieve 3D point deformation, which can
perform rigid transformation without skin-collapsing artifacts. In the endeavor
to register 2D pixels across different frames, we establish a correspondence
between canonical feature embeddings that encodes 3D points within the
canonical space, and 2D image features by solving an optimal transport problem.
Besides, we introduce a texture filtering approach for texture rendering that
effectively minimizes the impact of noisy colors outside target deformable
objects. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that our

temporal appearance constancy. Reconstructing dynamic body shapes with
volumetric neural rendering methods, such as NeRF, requires finding the
correspondence of the points in the canonical and observation space, which

vector field, which does not consider the appearance constancy of general body
shape. In this paper, we propose CAT-NeRF for self-awareness of appearance
constancy with Tx$^2$Former, a novel way to combine two Transformer layers, to
separate appearance constancy and uniqueness. Appearance constancy models the
general shape across the video, and uniqueness models the unique patterns for
each frame. We further introduce a novel Covariance Loss to limit the
correlation between each pair of appearance uniquenesses to ensure the

variance loss to regularize the variance of implicit neural representations to
reduce the geometry and color ambiguity in the learning procedure. These two

Most pioneering methods rely primarily on 2D representations and thus will
inevitably suffer from face distortion when large head rotations are

Nevertheless, the fidelity of identity and expression is not so desirable,

recently proposed Deformable Neural Radiance Fields, HiDe-NeRF represents the
3D dynamic scene into a canonical appearance field and an implicit deformation
field, where the former comprises the canonical source face and the latter
models the driving pose and expression. In particular, we improve fidelity from

changes; an event-based camera observes the change as sparse events. How can we
utilize sparse events for efficient recovery of the camera pose? We show that
we can recover the camera pose by minimizing the error between sparse events
and the temporal gradient of the scene represented as a neural radiance field
(NeRF). To enable the computation of the temporal gradient of the scene, we
augment NeRF's camera pose as a time function. When the input pose to the NeRF
coincides with the actual pose, the output of the temporal gradient of NeRF
equals the observed intensity changes on the event's points. Using this
principle, we propose an event-based camera pose tracking framework called
TeGRA which realizes the pose update by using the sparse event's observation.

rendering 3D scenes. However, most state-of-the-art implicit representations
model static or dynamic scenes as a whole, with minor variations. Existing work
on learning disentangled world and object neural fields do not consider the
problem of composing objects into different world neural fields in a

compositional synthesis of driving scenes in a physically consistent manner.
Specifically, we learn a scene representation that disentangles the static
background and transient elements into a world-NeRF and class-specific
object-NeRFs to allow compositional synthesis of multiple objects in the scene.
Furthermore, we explicitly designed both the world and object models to handle
lighting variation, which allows us to compose objects into scenes with
spatially varying lighting. This is achieved by constructing a light field of
the scene and using it in conjunction with a learned shader to modulate the
appearance of the object NeRFs. We demonstrate the performance of our model on
a synthetic dataset of diverse lighting conditions rendered with the CARLA

Deformation module, which creates a pose-independent generalizable deformation
field by disentangling backward and forward deformation correspondences into
shared skeletal motion weight and separate non-rigid motions. Then, we devise a
Forward Correspondence Search module, which queries the correspondence feature

as a function of corresponding coordinates which emerges as a sharp weapon for
solving inverse problems. However, the expressive power of INR is limited by
the spectral bias in the network training. In this paper, we find that such a
frequency-related problem could be greatly solved by re-arranging the
coordinates of the input signal, for which we propose the disorder-invariant
implicit neural representation (DINER) by augmenting a hash-table to a
traditional INR backbone. Given discrete signals sharing the same histogram of
attributes and different arrangement orders, the hash-table could project the
coordinates into the same distribution for which the mapped signal can be
better modeled using the subsequent INR network, leading to significantly
alleviated spectral bias. Furthermore, the expressive power of the DINER is
determined by the width of the hash-table. Different width corresponds to
different geometrical elements in the attribute space, \textit{e.g.}, 1D curve,
2D curved-plane and 3D curved-volume when the width is set as $1$, $2$ and $3$,
respectively. More covered areas of the geometrical elements result in stronger
expressive power. Experiments not only reveal the generalization of the DINER

representation, named TriVol, that can be combined with NeRF to render
photo-realistic images from point clouds. Our TriVol consists of triple slim
volumes, each of which is encoded from the point cloud. TriVol has two
advantages. First, it fuses respective fields at different scales and thus
extracts local and non-local features for discriminative representation.
Second, since the volume size is greatly reduced, our 3D decoder can be
efficiently inferred, allowing us to increase the resolution of the 3D space to
render more point details. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks with
varying kinds of scenes/objects demonstrate our framework's effectiveness

multi-view image stylization for the 3D scene. Our approach models a neural

encoder into two parts, the content and style sub-branches, and train the
network for normal novel view image synthesis with the content and style

position encoder, with content and style voxel grid features as reference. With
the adjusted features, the stylization of novel view images could be obtained.
Our method extends the style target from style images to image sets of scenes
and does not require additional network training for stylization. Given a set
of images of 3D scenes and a style target(a style image or another set of 3D

equipping each Voronoi cell with its own NeRF, our approach is able to quickly
learn a scene representation. We propose an intuitive partitioning of the space

To overcome these limitations, we propose Cube-based Neural Radiance Field

number of views are available. To complement the lack of 3D information,
depth-based models, such as DSNeRF and MonoSDF, explicitly assume the
availability of accurate depth maps of multiple views. They linearly scale the
accurate depth maps as supervision to guide the predicted depth of few-shot
NeRFs. However, accurate depth maps are difficult and expensive to capture due
to wide-range depth distances in the wild.
  In this work, we present a new Sparse-view NeRF (SparseNeRF) framework that
exploits depth priors from real-world inaccurate observations. The inaccurate
depth observations are either from pre-trained depth models or coarse depth
maps of consumer-level depth sensors. Since coarse depth maps are not strictly
scaled to the ground-truth depth maps, we propose a simple yet effective
constraint, a local depth ranking method, on NeRFs such that the expected depth
ranking of the NeRF is consistent with that of the coarse depth maps in local
patches. To preserve the spatial continuity of the estimated depth of NeRF, we
further propose a spatial continuity constraint to encourage the consistency of
the expected depth continuity of NeRF with coarse depth maps. Surprisingly,

not model the change of the reflected color during the warping. As a result,
this approach often fails drastically on challenging specular objects in

Additionally, we add the mask of moving objects to guide the deformation field.
As the specular surface changes color during motion, the mask mitigates the

structures to efficiently encode static, dynamic, and far-field radiance
fields, and (b) we make use of unlabeled target signals consisting of RGB

from underfitting with blurred renderings on large-scale scenes due to limited
model capacity. Recent approaches propose to geographically divide the scene
and adopt multiple sub-NeRFs to model each region individually, leading to
linear scale-up in training costs and the number of sub-NeRFs as the scene
expands. An alternative solution is to use a feature grid representation, which
is computationally efficient and can naturally scale to a large scene with
increased grid resolutions. However, the feature grid tends to be less
constrained and often reaches suboptimal solutions, producing noisy artifacts
in renderings, especially in regions with complex geometry and texture. In this
work, we present a new framework that realizes high-fidelity rendering on large
urban scenes while being computationally efficient. We propose to use a compact
multiresolution ground feature plane representation to coarsely capture the
scene, and complement it with positional encoding inputs through another NeRF
branch for rendering in a joint learning fashion. We show that such an
integration can utilize the advantages of two alternative solutions: a
light-weighted NeRF is sufficient, under the guidance of the feature grid
representation, to render photorealistic novel views with fine details; and the
jointly optimized ground feature planes, can meanwhile gain further
refinements, forming a more accurate and compact feature space and output much
more natural rendering results.";Linning Xu<author:sep>Yuanbo Xiangli<author:sep>Sida Peng<author:sep>Xingang Pan<author:sep>Nanxuan Zhao<author:sep>Christian Theobalt<author:sep>Bo Dai<author:sep>Dahua Lin;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.14001v1;cs.CV;CVPR2023, Project page at https://city-super.github.io/gridnerf/;nerf

optimising a continuous volumetric scene function. Its large success which lies
in applying volumetric rendering (VR) is also its Achilles' heel in producing
view-dependent effects. As a consequence, glossy and transparent surfaces often
appear murky. A remedy to reduce these artefacts is to constrain this VR
equation by excluding volumes with back-facing normal. While this approach has
some success in rendering glossy surfaces, translucent objects are still poorly
represented. In this paper, we present an alternative to the physics-based VR
approach by introducing a self-attention-based framework on volumes along a
ray. In addition, inspired by modern game engines which utilise Light Probes to
store local lighting passing through the scene, we incorporate Learnable
Embeddings to capture view dependent effects within the scene. Our method,

with pre-trained diffusion models for text-to-3D object generation. However,
one enduring challenge is their inadequate capability to accurately parse and
regenerate consistent multi-object environments. Specifically, these models
encounter difficulties in accurately representing quantity and style prompted
by multi-object texts, often resulting in a collapse of the rendering fidelity
that fails to match the semantic intricacies. Moreover, amalgamating these
elements into a coherent 3D scene is a substantial challenge, stemming from
generic distribution inherent in diffusion models. To tackle the issue of
'guidance collapse' and enhance consistency, we propose a novel framework,
dubbed CompoNeRF, by integrating an editable 3D scene layout with object
specific and scene-wide guidance mechanisms. It initiates by interpreting a
complex text into an editable 3D layout populated with multiple NeRFs, each
paired with a corresponding subtext prompt for precise object depiction. Next,
a tailored composition module seamlessly blends these NeRFs, promoting
consistency, while the dual-level text guidance reduces ambiguity and boosts
accuracy. Noticeably, the unique modularity of CompoNeRF permits NeRF
decomposition. This enables flexible scene editing and recomposition into new
scenes based on the edited layout or text prompts. Utilizing the open source
Stable Diffusion model, CompoNeRF not only generates scenes with high fidelity
but also paves the way for innovative multi-object composition using editable

witnessed the rise of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Nevertheless, it is not
trivial to exploit NeRF for the photorealistic 3D scene stylization task, which
aims to generate visually consistent and photorealistic stylized scenes from
novel views. Simply coupling NeRF with photorealistic style transfer (PST) will
result in cross-view inconsistency and degradation of stylized view syntheses.
Through a thorough analysis, we demonstrate that this non-trivial task can be
simplified in a new light: When transforming the appearance representation of a
pre-trained NeRF with Lipschitz mapping, the consistency and photorealism
across source views will be seamlessly encoded into the syntheses. That
motivates us to build a concise and flexible learning framework namely LipRF,
which upgrades arbitrary 2D PST methods with Lipschitz mapping tailored for the
3D scene. Technically, LipRF first pre-trains a radiance field to reconstruct
the 3D scene, and then emulates the style on each view by 2D PST as the prior
to learn a Lipschitz network to stylize the pre-trained appearance. In view of
that Lipschitz condition highly impacts the expressivity of the neural network,
we devise an adaptive regularization to balance the reconstruction and
stylization. A gradual gradient aggregation strategy is further introduced to
optimize LipRF in a cost-efficient manner. We conduct extensive experiments to

the object's placement in the generated scene and optionally defines its coarse

that using proxies allows a wide variety of editing options, such as adjusting

which can generalize across scenes. A key challenge is that monocular depth

Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cIMLE). In order to disambiguate

Despite the success of universal optimization-based methods for 2D GAN
inversion, those applied to 3D GANs may fail to extrapolate the result onto the

time-consuming and can require at least several minutes per image. Fast
encoder-based techniques, such as those developed for StyleGAN, may also be
less appealing due to the lack of identity preservation. Our work introduces a
fast technique that bridges the gap between the two approaches by directly
utilizing the tri-plane representation presented for the EG3D generative model.
In particular, we build upon a feed-forward convolutional encoder for the

numerical offsets. The renderings are similar in quality to the ones produced
by optimization-based techniques and outperform the ones by encoder-based

neural implicit surfaces with a signed distance function (SDF) for
reconstructing three-dimensional surfaces in NLOS scenes. We introduce two
constraints as loss functions for correctly learning an SDF to avoid non-zero
level-set surfaces. We also introduce a lower bound constraint of an SDF based
on the geometry of the first-returning photons. The experimental results
indicate that these constraints are essential for learning a correct SDF in
NLOS scenes. Compared with previous methods with discretized representation,
NLOS-NeuS with the neural continuous representation enables us to reconstruct
smooth surfaces while preserving fine details in NLOS scenes. To the best of

Users can edit the scene with translation, rotation, scaling, or combinations.
The operations on the corners and edges of the cage are also supported. Our

sampling-invariant content transformation that makes the transformation
invariant to the holistic statistics of the sampled 3D points and accordingly
ensures multi-view consistency. The second is deferred style transformation of
2D feature maps which is equivalent to the transformation of 3D points but
greatly reduces memory footprint without degrading multi-view consistency.

the impressive performance of NeRF, where low-dimensional coordinates are
mapped to high-dimensional space to better recover scene details. However,
blindly increasing the frequency of P.E. leads to overfitting when the
reconstruction problem is highly underconstrained, \eg, few-shot images for
training. We harness low-frequency neural fields to regularize high-frequency
neural fields from overfitting to better address the problem of few-shot view
synthesis. We propose reconstructing with a low-frequency only field and then
finishing details with a high-frequency equipped field. Unlike most existing
solutions that regularize the output space (\ie, rendered images), our
regularization is conducted in the input space (\ie, signal frequency). We
further propose a simple-yet-effective strategy for tuning the frequency to
avoid overfitting few-shot inputs: enforcing consistency among the frequency
domain of rendered 2D images. Thanks to the input space regularizing scheme,

problem due to clothing, occlusion, texture discontinuities and sharpness, and
framespecific pose changes. Many methods employ deferred rendering, NeRFs and
implicit methods to represent clothed humans, on the premise that mesh-based
representations cannot capture complex clothing and textures from RGB,
silhouettes, and keypoints alone. We provide a counter viewpoint to this
fundamental premise by optimizing a SMPL+D mesh and an efficient,
multi-resolution texture representation using only RGB images, binary
silhouettes and sparse 2D keypoints. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach is more capable of capturing geometric details compared to visual
hull, mesh-based methods. We show competitive novel view synthesis and
improvements in novel pose synthesis compared to NeRF-based methods, which
introduce noticeable, unwanted artifacts. By restricting the solution space to
the SMPL+D model combined with differentiable rendering, we obtain dramatic
speedups in compute, training times (up to 24x) and inference times (up to
192x). Our method therefore can be used as is or as a fast initialization to

involves synthesizing new views of a scene from a limited set of input images.
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a powerful approach to address

integrated into existing NeRF architectures with minimal modifications. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of static and dynamic

of the fields. However, in practice, only a tiny opaque portion of the ray
contributes most of the radiance to the sum. We propose a simple end-to-end
differentiable sampling algorithm based on inverse transform sampling. It
generates samples according to the probability distribution induced by the
density field and picks non-transparent points on the ray. We utilize the
algorithm in two ways. First, we propose a novel rendering approach based on
Monte Carlo estimates. This approach allows for evaluating and optimizing a
neural radiance field with just a few radiance field calls per ray. Second, we
use the sampling algorithm to modify the hierarchical scheme proposed in the
original NeRF work. We show that our modification improves reconstruction
quality of hierarchical models, at the same time simplifying the training

potentials for high-quality 3D shape generation. However, most existing work
based on diffusion models only focus on geometric shape generation, they cannot
either accomplish 3D reconstruction from a single image, or produce 3D
geometric shape with color information. In this work, we propose to reconstruct
a 3D colored shape from a single RGB image through a novel conditional
diffusion model. The reverse process of the proposed diffusion model is
consisted of three modules, shape prediction module, color prediction module
and NeRF-like rendering module. In shape prediction module, the reference RGB
image is first encoded into a high-level shape feature and then the shape
feature is utilized as a condition to predict the reverse geometric noise in
diffusion model. Then the color of each 3D point updated in shape prediction
module is predicted by color prediction module. Finally, a NeRF-like rendering
module is designed to render the colored point cloud predicted by the former
two modules to 2D image space to guide the training conditioned only on a

diffusion model for 3D colored shape reconstruction from a single RGB image.

free-viewpoint videos. However, they are inherently unsuitable for interactive
streaming scenarios (e.g. video conferencing, telepresence) because have an
inevitable lag even if the training is instantaneous. This is because these
approaches consume videos and thus have to buffer chunks of frames (often
seconds) before processing. In this work, we take a step towards interactive
streaming via a frame-by-frame approach naturally free of lag. Conventional
wisdom believes that per-frame NeRFs are impractical due to prohibitive
training costs and storage. We break this belief by introducing Incremental
Neural Videos (INV), a per-frame NeRF that is efficiently trained and
streamable. We designed INV based on two insights: (1) Our main finding is that
MLPs naturally partition themselves into Structure and Color Layers, which
store structural and color/texture information respectively. (2) We leverage
this property to retain and improve upon knowledge from previous frames, thus
amortizing training across frames and reducing redundant learning. As a result,
with negligible changes to NeRF, INV can achieve good qualities (>28.6db) in
8min/frame. It can also outperform prior SOTA in 19% less training time.
Additionally, our Temporal Weight Compression reduces the per-frame size to
0.3MB/frame (6.6% of NeRF). More importantly, INV is free from buffer lag and
is naturally fit for streaming. While this work does not achieve real-time
training, it shows that incremental approaches like INV present new
possibilities in interactive 3D streaming. Moreover, our discovery of natural

concatenation of weights and biases of a pre-trained MLP and processes it using
a composition of layers that are equivariant to the natural permutation
symmetry of the MLP's weights: Changing the order of neurons in intermediate
layers of the MLP does not affect the function it represents. We provide a full

to train one independent model for each scene and suffer from heavy
computational costs when applying to increasing monocular videos in real-world

point features and scene flows with point trajectory and feature correspondence
constraints across frames. More specifically, we learn an implicit velocity
field to estimate point trajectory from temporal features with Neural ODE,
which is followed by a flow-based feature aggregation module to obtain spatial
features along the point trajectory. We jointly optimize temporal and spatial

reconstruction in the wild, this work explores reconstructing general
real-world objects from a few images without known camera poses or object
categories. The crux of our work is solving two fundamental 3D vision problems
-- shape reconstruction and pose estimation -- in a unified approach. Our
approach captures the synergies of these two problems: reliable camera pose
estimation gives rise to accurate shape reconstruction, and the accurate
reconstruction, in turn, induces robust correspondence between different views
and facilitates pose estimation. Our method FORGE predicts 3D features from
each view and leverages them in conjunction with the input images to establish
cross-view correspondence for estimating relative camera poses. The 3D features
are then transformed by the estimated poses into a shared space and are fused
into a neural radiance field. The reconstruction results are rendered by volume
rendering techniques, enabling us to train the model without 3D shape
ground-truth. Our experiments show that FORGE reliably reconstructs objects
from five views. Our pose estimation method outperforms existing ones by a
large margin. The reconstruction results under predicted poses are comparable
to the ones using ground-truth poses. The performance on novel testing
categories matches the results on categories seen during training. Project

360{\textdegree} image of ERP format that has spatial distortion in their high
latitude regions and a 360{\textdegree} wide viewing angle, NeRF's general ray
sampling strategy is ineffective. Hence, the view synthesis accuracy of NeRF is
limited and learning is not efficient. We propose two non-uniform ray sampling
schemes for NeRF to suit 360{\textdegree} images - distortion-aware ray
sampling and content-aware ray sampling. We created an evaluation dataset
Synth360 using Replica and SceneCity models of indoor and outdoor scenes,

require dense input signals such as video or multi-view images, or leverage a
learned prior from large-scale specific 3D human datasets such that
reconstruction can be performed with sparse-view inputs. Most of these methods

increased attention. As reconstruction from large-scale multi-view data
involves immense memory and computational requirements, recent benchmark
datasets provide collections of single monocular views per timestamp sampled
from multiple (virtual) cameras. We refer to this form of inputs as
""monocularized"" data. Existing work shows impressive results for synthetic
setups and forward-facing real-world data, but is often limited in the training
speed and angular range for generating novel views. This paper addresses these
limitations and proposes a new method for full 360{\deg} inward-facing novel
view synthesis of non-rigidly deforming scenes. At the core of our method are:
1) An efficient deformation module that decouples the processing of spatial and
temporal information for accelerated training and inference; and 2) A static
module representing the canonical scene as a fast hash-encoded neural radiance
field. In addition to existing synthetic monocularized data, we systematically
analyze the performance on real-world inward-facing scenes using a newly
recorded challenging dataset sampled from a synchronized large-scale multi-view
rig. In both cases, our method is significantly faster than previous methods,
converging in less than 7 minutes and achieving real-time framerates at 1K
resolution, while obtaining a higher visual accuracy for generated novel views.

high-quality and versatile representations for 3D scenes, and enable downstream
tasks such as editing, retrieval, navigation, etc. Various neural architectures
are vying for the core structure of NeRF, including the plain Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP), sparse tensors, low-rank tensors, hashtables and their
compositions. Each of these representations has its particular set of
trade-offs. For example, the hashtable-based representations admit faster
training and rendering but their lack of clear geometric meaning hampers
downstream tasks like spatial-relation-aware editing. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Volume Distillation (PVD), a systematic distillation method that
allows any-to-any conversions between different architectures, including MLP,
sparse or low-rank tensors, hashtables and their compositions. PVD consequently
empowers downstream applications to optimally adapt the neural representations
for the task at hand in a post hoc fashion. The conversions are fast, as
distillation is progressively performed on different levels of volume
representations, from shallower to deeper. We also employ special treatment of
density to deal with its specific numerical instability problem. Empirical
evidence is presented to validate our method on the NeRF-Synthetic, LLFF and

directions for improving NeRF, represented by methods like Plenoxels and DVGO,
which achieve super-fast training convergence and real-time rendering. However,
these methods typically require a tremendous storage overhead, costing up to
hundreds of megabytes of disk space and runtime memory for a single scene. We
address this issue in this paper by introducing a simple yet effective
framework, called vector quantized radiance fields (VQRF), for compressing
these volume-grid-based radiance fields. We first present a robust and adaptive
metric for estimating redundancy in grid models and performing voxel pruning by
better exploring intermediate outputs of volumetric rendering. A trainable
vector quantization is further proposed to improve the compactness of grid
models. In combination with an efficient joint tuning strategy and
post-processing, our method can achieve a compression ratio of 100$\times$ by
reducing the overall model size to 1 MB with negligible loss on visual quality.

practical 3D modeling pipelines such as 3D scene creation and rendering. Due to
the technical difficulty, one can only obtain rough 3D models (R3DMs) for most
real objects using existing 3D reconstruction techniques. As a result,
physically-based rendering (PBR) would render low-quality images or videos for
scenes that are constructed by R3DMs. One promising solution would be
representing real-world objects as Neural Fields such as NeRFs, which are able
to generate photo-realistic renderings of an object under desired viewpoints.
However, a drawback is that the synthesized views through Neural Fields
Rendering (NFR) cannot reflect the simulated lighting details on R3DMs in PBR
pipelines, especially when object interactions in the 3D scene creation cause
local shadows. To solve this dilemma, we propose a lighting transfer network

LighTNet reasons about a simplified image composition model, remedies the

can provide 3D priors as condition information for the following diffusion
process. During denoising diffusion, we further enhance the 3D consistency by

increases algorithm performance, there are hard limitations to the number and

render synthetic views from arbitrary camera positions, virtually enlarging the

paired calibrated camera parameters. However, previous NeRF-based systems have
been demonstrated under strictly controlled settings, with little attention
paid to less ideal scenarios, including with the presence of noise such as
exposure, illumination changes, and blur. In particular, though blur frequently
occurs in real situations, NeRF that can handle blurred images has received
little attention. The few studies that have investigated NeRF for blurred

which is one of the most important factors in 3D reconstruction. This leads to
inconsistency and the degradation of the perceptual quality of the constructed

We refer to this task as 3D inpainting. In 3D, solutions must be both
consistent across multiple views and geometrically valid. In this paper, we

Using the mask, a perceptual optimizationbased approach is then introduced that
leverages learned 2D image inpainters, distilling their information into 3D

the recent variant mip-NeRF proposes an Integrated Positional Encoding (IPE)

inspiring major breakthroughs in text-guided shape generation. Recently, it has
been shown that using score distillation, one can successfully text-guide a
NeRF model to generate a 3D object. We adapt the score distillation to the
publicly available, and computationally efficient, Latent Diffusion Models,
which apply the entire diffusion process in a compact latent space of a
pretrained autoencoder. As NeRFs operate in image space, a naive solution for
guiding them with latent score distillation would require encoding to the
latent space at each guidance step. Instead, we propose to bring the NeRF to
the latent space, resulting in a Latent-NeRF. Analyzing our Latent-NeRF, we
show that while Text-to-3D models can generate impressive results, they are
inherently unconstrained and may lack the ability to guide or enforce a
specific 3D structure. To assist and direct the 3D generation, we propose to
guide our Latent-NeRF using a Sketch-Shape: an abstract geometry that defines
the coarse structure of the desired object. Then, we present means to integrate
such a constraint directly into a Latent-NeRF. This unique combination of text
and shape guidance allows for increased control over the generation process. We
also show that latent score distillation can be successfully applied directly
on 3D meshes. This allows for generating high-quality textures on a given

1) preserve the identity of the input image, but also 2) ensure 3D consistency

the first stage, we introduce a base encoder that converts the input image to a

synthesize 3D consistent novel view images, we utilize identity contrastive
learning to train the base encoder. Second, to better preserve the identity of

However, the underlying geometry of the scene is not explicitly constrained

representation from multi-view (MV) images. Yet, it cannot handle multi-scale
(MS) images and camera pose estimation errors, which generally is the case with
multi-view images captured from a day-to-day commodity camera. Although
recently proposed Mip-NeRF could handle multi-scale imaging problems with NeRF,
it cannot handle camera pose estimation error. On the other hand, the newly
proposed BARF can solve the camera pose problem with NeRF but fails if the
images are multi-scale in nature. This paper presents a robust multi-scale
neural radiance fields representation approach to simultaneously overcome both
real-world imaging issues. Our method handles multi-scale imaging effects and
camera-pose estimation problems with NeRF-inspired approaches by leveraging the
fundamentals of scene rigidity. To reduce unpleasant aliasing artifacts due to
multi-scale images in the ray space, we leverage Mip-NeRF multi-scale
representation. For joint estimation of robust camera pose, we propose
graph-neural network-based multiple motion averaging in the neural volume
rendering framework. We demonstrate, with examples, that for an accurate neural
representation of an object from day-to-day acquired multi-view images, it is
crucial to have precise camera-pose estimates. Without considering robustness

the likelihood of overfitting. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a
novel method to generate geometrically consistent image transitions between
viewpoints using View Morphing. Our VM-NeRF approach requires no prior
knowledge about the scene structure, as View Morphing is based on the
fundamental principles of projective geometry. VM-NeRF tightly integrates this
geometric view generation process during the training procedure of standard

synthesis, particularly when only a few views are available. Experimental

ViewFool to find adversarial viewpoints that mislead visual recognition models.
By encoding real-world objects as neural radiance fields (NeRF), ViewFool
characterizes a distribution of diverse adversarial viewpoints under an
entropic regularizer, which helps to handle the fluctuations of the real camera
pose and mitigate the reality gap between the real objects and their neural

extremely vulnerable to the generated adversarial viewpoints, which also
exhibit high cross-model transferability. Based on ViewFool, we introduce
ImageNet-V, a new out-of-distribution dataset for benchmarking viewpoint

from a single image, video, or a set of 3D scans, several limitations remain.
Most methods use a holistic representation to jointly model the body and
clothing, which means that the clothing and body cannot be separated for
applications like virtual try-on. Other methods separately model the body and
clothing, but they require training from a large set of 3D clothed human meshes
obtained from 3D/4D scanners or physics simulations. Our insight is that the
body and clothing have different modeling requirements. While the body is well
represented by a mesh-based parametric 3D model, implicit representations and
neural radiance fields are better suited to capturing the large variety in
shape and appearance present in clothing. Building on this insight, we propose
SCARF (Segmented Clothed Avatar Radiance Field), a hybrid model combining a

volumetric rendering in combination with a differentiable rasterizer enables us
to optimize SCARF directly from monocular videos, without any 3D supervision.
The hybrid modeling enables SCARF to (i) animate the clothed body avatar by
changing body poses (including hand articulation and facial expressions), (ii)
synthesize novel views of the avatar, and (iii) transfer clothing between
avatars in virtual try-on applications. We demonstrate that SCARF reconstructs

photo-realistic 2D images while capturing decent underlying 3D shapes. A
popular solution is to adopt the generative adversarial network (GAN) and
replace the generator with a 3D renderer, where volume rendering with neural
radiance field (NeRF) is commonly used. Despite the advancement of synthesis
quality, existing methods fail to obtain moderate 3D shapes. We argue that,
considering the two-player game in the formulation of GANs, only making the
generator 3D-aware is not enough. In other words, displacing the generative
mechanism only offers the capability, but not the guarantee, of producing
3D-aware images, because the supervision of the generator primarily comes from
the discriminator. To address this issue, we propose GeoD through learning a
geometry-aware discriminator to improve 3D-aware GANs. Concretely, besides
differentiating real and fake samples from the 2D image space, the
discriminator is additionally asked to derive the geometry information from the
inputs, which is then applied as the guidance of the generator. Such a simple
yet effective design facilitates learning substantially more accurate 3D
shapes. Extensive experiments on various generator architectures and training
datasets verify the superiority of GeoD over state-of-the-art alternatives.

radiance field (NeRF) based framework that combines local and global
conditioning under the introduction of symmetry priors. In particular, SymmNeRF
takes the pixel-aligned image features and the corresponding symmetric features
as extra inputs to the NeRF, whose parameters are generated by a hypernetwork.
As the parameters are conditioned on the image-encoded latent codes, SymmNeRF
is thus scene-independent and can generalize to new scenes. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that SymmNeRF synthesizes novel views
with more details regardless of the pose transformation, and demonstrates good
generalization when applied to unseen objects. Code is available at:

semantic consistency to guide the progressive training process. Firstly, the
input image is re-projected to $360^\circ$ images, and auxiliary depth maps are
extracted at other camera positions. The depth supervision, in addition to the
NeRF color guidance, improves the geometry of the synthesized views.
Additionally, we introduce a semantic consistency loss that encourages
realistic renderings of novel views. We extract these semantic features using a
pre-trained visual encoder such as CLIP, a Vision Transformer trained on
hundreds of millions of diverse 2D photographs mined from the web with natural

novel view synthesis and facilitate dense estimation of scene properties.
However, NeRFs often fail for large, unbounded scenes that are captured under
very sparse views with the scene content concentrated far away from the camera,
as is typical for field robotics applications. In particular, NeRF-style
algorithms perform poorly: (1) when there are insufficient views with little
pose diversity, (2) when scenes contain saturation and shadows, and (3) when
finely sampling large unbounded scenes with fine structures becomes
computationally intensive.
  This paper proposes CLONeR, which significantly improves upon NeRF by
allowing it to model large outdoor driving scenes that are observed from sparse
input sensor views. This is achieved by decoupling occupancy and color learning
within the NeRF framework into separate Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained
using LiDAR and camera data, respectively. In addition, this paper proposes a
novel method to build differentiable 3D Occupancy Grid Maps (OGM) alongside the
NeRF model, and leverage this occupancy grid for improved sampling of points

capturing and animation. But when involving the neural radiance field (NeRF),
learning a static NeRF in the canonical space is not enough because the

lighting is constant. Previous methods alleviate the inconsistency of lighting
by learning a per-frame embedding, but this operation does not generalize to
unseen poses. Given that the lighting condition is static in the world space
while the human body is consistent in the canonical space, we propose a
dual-space NeRF that models the scene lighting and the human body with two MLPs

rely on the linear blend skinning (LBS) algorithm. However, the blending
weights for LBS of a dynamic neural field are intractable and thus are usually
memorized with another MLP, which does not generalize to novel poses. Although
it is possible to borrow the blending weights of a parametric mesh such as
SMPL, the interpolation operation introduces more artifacts. In this paper, we

(QDLR-NeRF) representation for the task of light field compression. While
existing compression methods encode the set of light field sub-aperture images,
our proposed method learns an implicit scene representation in the form of a
Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which also enables view synthesis. To reduce its
size, the model is first learned under a Low-Rank (LR) constraint using a
Tensor Train (TT) decomposition within an Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM) optimization framework. To further reduce the model's size,
the components of the tensor train decomposition need to be quantized. However,
simultaneously considering the optimization of the NeRF model with both the
low-rank constraint and rate-constrained weight quantization is challenging. To
address this difficulty, we introduce a network distillation operation that
separates the low-rank approximation and the weight quantization during network
training. The information from the initial LR-constrained NeRF (LR-NeRF) is
distilled into a model of much smaller dimension (DLR-NeRF) based on the TT
decomposition of the LR-NeRF. We then learn an optimized global codebook to
quantize all TT components, producing the final QDLR-NeRF. Experimental results
show that our proposed method yields better compression efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art methods, and it additionally has the advantage of allowing the

transformers with the NeRF-like inductive bias. On the other hand, NeRFA
performs multi-stage attention to reduce the computational overhead.
Furthermore, the NeRFA model adopts the ray and pixel transformers to learn the
interactions between rays and pixels. NeRFA demonstrates superior performance

architecture that reconstructs Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and learns to
renders novel views on the fly from source views. While prior works on NeRFs
optimize a scene representation by inverting a handcrafted rendering equation,
GNT achieves neural representation and rendering that generalizes across scenes
using transformers at two stages. (1) The view transformer leverages multi-view
geometry as an inductive bias for attention-based scene representation, and
predicts coordinate-aligned features by aggregating information from epipolar
lines on the neighboring views. (2) The ray transformer renders novel views
using attention to decode the features from the view transformer along the
sampled points during ray marching. Our experiments demonstrate that when
optimized on a single scene, GNT can successfully reconstruct NeRF without an
explicit rendering formula due to the learned ray renderer. When trained on
multiple scenes, GNT consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance when
transferring to unseen scenes and outperform all other methods by ~10% on
average. Our analysis of the learned attention maps to infer depth and

differentially rendering multi-view images with ground-truth supervision.
However, when interpolating novel views, NeRF often yields inconsistent and
visually non-smooth geometric results, which we consider as a generalization
gap between seen and unseen views. Recent advances in convolutional neural
networks have demonstrated the promise of advanced robust data augmentations,
either random or learned, in enhancing both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution generalization. Inspired by that, we propose Augmented NeRF
(Aug-NeRF), which for the first time brings the power of robust data
augmentations into regularizing the NeRF training. Particularly, our proposal
learns to seamlessly blend worst-case perturbations into three distinct levels
of the NeRF pipeline with physical grounds, including (1) the input
coordinates, to simulate imprecise camera parameters at image capture; (2)
intermediate features, to smoothen the intrinsic feature manifold; and (3)
pre-rendering output, to account for the potential degradation factors in the
multi-view image supervision. Extensive results demonstrate that Aug-NeRF
effectively boosts NeRF performance in both novel view synthesis (up to 1.5dB
PSNR gain) and underlying geometry reconstruction. Furthermore, thanks to the
implicit smooth prior injected by the triple-level augmentations, Aug-NeRF can
even recover scenes from heavily corrupted images, a highly challenging setting
untackled before. Our codes are available in

non-rigid deformations, tool occlusion and poor 3D clues from a single

event cameras can measure subtle brightness changes in high frame rates, the
measurements in low lighting or extreme motion suffer from significant domain
discrepancy with complex noise. As a result, the performance of event-based
vision tasks does not transfer to challenging environments, where the event
cameras are expected to thrive over normal cameras. We find that the multi-view
consistency of NeRF provides a powerful self-supervision signal for eliminating
the spurious measurements and extracting the consistent underlying structure
despite highly noisy input. Instead of posed images of the original NeRF, the
input to Ev-NeRF is the event measurements accompanied by the movements of the
sensors. Using the loss function that reflects the measurement model of the
sensor, Ev-NeRF creates an integrated neural volume that summarizes the
unstructured and sparse data points captured for about 2-4 seconds. The
generated neural volume can also produce intensity images from novel views with

synthesis and scene reconstruction, with applications ranging from large static
scenes to dynamic human motion. However, the increased resolution and
model-free nature of such neural fields come at the cost of high training times

by using complementary data structures yet these methods are ill-suited for
dynamic scenes and often increase memory consumption. Little has been done to
reduce the resources required at training time. We propose a method to exploit
the redundancy of NeRF's sample-based computations by partially sharing
evaluations across neighboring sample points. Our UNeRF architecture is
inspired by the UNet, where spatial resolution is reduced in the middle of the
network and information is shared between adjacent samples. Although this
change violates the strict and conscious separation of view-dependent
appearance and view-independent density estimation in the NeRF method, we show
that it improves novel view synthesis. We also introduce an alternative
subsampling strategy which shares computation while minimizing any violation of
view invariance. UNeRF is a plug-in module for the original NeRF network. Our
major contributions include reduction of the memory footprint, improved
accuracy, and reduced amortized processing time both during training and

non-trivial and needs to be addressed during training. We evaluate rendering
performance on a GPU-accelerated ray-caster with in-shader neural network

satisfying tradeoff between storage costs and rendering quality. In fact, our
evaluation for rendering quality and surface recovery shows that KiloNeuS
outperforms its single-MLP counterpart. Finally, to exhibit the versatility of

either assume knowledge of obstacles and lighting, or only focus on simple
fluid scenes without obstacles or complex lighting, and thus are unsuitable for
real-world scenes with unknown lighting or arbitrary obstacles. We present the
first method to reconstruct dynamic fluid by leveraging the governing physics

With a hybrid architecture that separates static and dynamic contents, fluid

radiance fields with physics-informed deep learning, our method benefits from
the supervision of images and physical priors. To achieve robust optimization

composition of NeRFs, richly representing individual objects. To evaluate the
quality of the learned representations, ObPose is evaluated quantitatively on
the YCB, MultiShapeNet, and CLEVR datatasets for unsupervised scene
segmentation, outperforming the current state-of-the-art in 3D scene inference

demonstration that the same ObPose model can both generate novel scenes and
flexibly edit the objects in them. These capacities again reflect the quality

a practical and useful technique for many real-world applications. Recently,
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a rendering technique that uses neural networks
to approximate classical ray tracing, have been considered as one of the
promising approaches for synthesizing novel views from a sparse set of images.
We find that NeRF can render new views while maintaining geometric consistency,
but it does not properly maintain skin details, such as moles and pores. These
details are important particularly for faces because when we look at an image
of a face, we are much more sensitive to details than when we look at other
objects. On the other hand, 3D Morpable Models (3DMMs) based on traditional
meshes and textures can perform well in terms of skin detail despite that it
has less precise geometry and cannot cover the head and the entire scene with
background. Based on these observations, we propose a method to use both NeRF
and 3DMM to synthesize a high-fidelity novel view of a scene with a face. Our
method learns a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to mix a NeRF-synthesized
image and a 3DMM-rendered image and produces a photorealistic scene with a face

fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Neural approaches such
as NeRF have achieved photorealistic results on novel view synthesis, but they
require known camera poses. Solving this problem with unknown camera poses is
highly challenging as it requires joint optimization over shape, radiance, and
pose. This problem is exacerbated when the input images are captured in the
wild with varying backgrounds and illuminations. Standard pose estimation
techniques fail in such image collections in the wild due to very few estimated
correspondences across images. Furthermore, NeRF cannot relight a scene under
any illumination, as it operates on radiance (the product of reflectance and
illumination). We propose a joint optimization framework to estimate the shape,
BRDF, and per-image camera pose and illumination. Our method works on
in-the-wild online image collections of an object and produces relightable 3D
assets for several use-cases such as AR/VR. To our knowledge, our method is the
first to tackle this severely unconstrained task with minimal user interaction.

explicit and discrete voxel-based representations. However, it is quite
challenging to train such a representation which has a large number of model

we devise a novel static-to-dynamic learning paradigm together with a new data

efficient learning of deformable radiance fields via utilizing the 3D
volumetric canonical space learnt from multi-view static images to ease the

well-developed mesh-based deformation methods to deform the mesh representation
of the scene. Our method then utilizes user edits from the mesh representation
to bend the camera rays by introducing a tetrahedra mesh as a proxy, obtaining
the rendering results of the edited scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate

feature volumes are independent of the rendering model, we can manipulate and

latent features guided by a parametric body model. The output of DiffRas is
then used as conditioning to our conditional neural 3D representation module
(c-NeRF) which generates the final high-res image along with body geometry
using volumetric rendering. While DiffRas helps in obtaining photo-realistic

NeRF-based methods generate 3D defocus effects in a post-process fashion by
utilizing multiplane technology. Still, they are either time-consuming or
memory-consuming. This paper proposes a novel thin-lens-imaging-based NeRF
framework that can directly render various 3D defocus effects, dubbed NeRFocus.
Unlike the pinhole, the thin lens refracts rays of a scene point, so its
imaging on the sensor plane is scattered as a circle of confusion (CoC). A
direct solution sampling enough rays to approximate this process is
computationally expensive. Instead, we propose to inverse the thin lens imaging
to explicitly model the beam path for each point on the sensor plane and
generalize this paradigm to the beam path of each pixel, then use the
frustum-based volume rendering to render each pixel's beam path. We further
design an efficient probabilistic training (p-training) strategy to simplify
the training process vastly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
NeRFocus can achieve various 3D defocus effects with adjustable camera pose,
focus distance, and aperture size. Existing NeRF can be regarded as our special
case by setting aperture size as zero to render large depth-of-field images.

generation and manipulation in space and time. With a single image at inference
time, our novel framework allows the user to move objects in 3D while
generating a video by providing a sequence of desired actions. The actions are
learnt in an unsupervised manner. The camera can be controlled to get the
desired viewpoint. Our method builds an environment state for each frame, which
can be manipulated by our proposed action module and decoded back to the image
space with volumetric rendering. To support diverse appearances of objects, we
extend neural radiance fields with style-based modulation. Our method trains on
a collection of various monocular videos requiring only the estimated camera
parameters and 2D object locations. To set a challenging benchmark, we
introduce two large scale video datasets with significant camera movements. As
evidenced by our experiments, playable environments enable several creative

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have recently been shown to be remarkably
effective for performing view synthesis on objects with thin structures or
reflective materials. In this paper we explore the use of NeRF as a new source
of supervision for robust robot vision systems. In particular, we demonstrate
that a NeRF representation of a scene can be used to train dense object
descriptors. We use an optimized NeRF to extract dense correspondences between
multiple views of an object, and then use these correspondences as training
data for learning a view-invariant representation of the object. NeRF's usage
of a density field allows us to reformulate the correspondence problem with a
novel distribution-of-depths formulation, as opposed to the conventional
approach of using a depth map. Dense correspondence models supervised with our

image observations based on implicit object encoders, Neural Radiance Fields

representing scenes due to their strong 3D prior. However, most NeRF approaches
are trained on a single scene, representing the whole scene with a global
model, making generalization to novel scenes, containing different numbers of
objects, challenging. Instead, we present a compositional, object-centric
auto-encoder framework that maps multiple views of the scene to a set of latent
vectors representing each object separately. The latent vectors parameterize
individual NeRFs from which the scene can be reconstructed. Based on those
latent vectors, we train a graph neural network dynamics model in the latent
space to achieve compositionality for dynamics prediction. A key feature of our
approach is that the latent vectors are forced to encode 3D information through
the NeRF decoder, which enables us to incorporate structural priors in learning
the dynamics models, making long-term predictions more stable compared to
several baselines. Simulated and real world experiments show that our method

the generalizable NeRF technique to generate the tree via spatial blending. To
tackle dynamic scenes, we tailor the implicit network to model the Fourier

technique called neural volumetric video or NeuVV to support immersive,
interactive, and spatial-temporal rendering of volumetric video contents with
photo-realism and in real-time. The core of NeuVV is to efficiently encode a
dynamic neural radiance field (NeRF) into renderable and editable primitives.
We introduce two types of factorization schemes: a hyper-spherical harmonics
(HH) decomposition for modeling smooth color variations over space and time and
a learnable basis representation for modeling abrupt density and color changes
caused by motion. NeuVV factorization can be integrated into a Video Octree
(VOctree) analogous to PlenOctree to significantly accelerate training while
reducing memory overhead. Real-time NeuVV rendering further enables a class of
immersive content editing tools. Specifically, NeuVV treats each VOctree as a
primitive and implements volume-based depth ordering and alpha blending to
realize spatial-temporal compositions for content re-purposing. For example, we
demonstrate positioning varied manifestations of the same performance at
different 3D locations with different timing, adjusting color/texture of the

specialized sensors (e.g., synchronized multi-camera systems), or pre-built 3D
deformable models (e.g., SMAL or SMPL). Such methods are not able to scale to
diverse sets of objects in the wild. We present BANMo, a method that requires
neither a specialized sensor nor a pre-defined template shape. BANMo builds
high-fidelity, articulated 3D models (including shape and animatable skinning
weights) from many monocular casual videos in a differentiable rendering
framework. While the use of many videos provides more coverage of camera views
and object articulations, they introduce significant challenges in establishing
correspondence across scenes with different backgrounds, illumination
conditions, etc. Our key insight is to merge three schools of thought; (1)
classic deformable shape models that make use of articulated bones and blend
skinning, (2) volumetric neural radiance fields (NeRFs) that are amenable to
gradient-based optimization, and (3) canonical embeddings that generate
correspondences between pixels and an articulated model. We introduce neural
blend skinning models that allow for differentiable and invertible articulated
deformations. When combined with canonical embeddings, such models allow us to
establish dense correspondences across videos that can be self-supervised with
cycle consistency. On real and synthetic datasets, BANMo shows higher-fidelity

optimization difficulty. To alleviate these two problems, we propose a novel
framework, termed as VolumeGAN, for high-fidelity 3D-aware image synthesis,
through explicitly learning a structural representation and a textural
representation. We first learn a feature volume to represent the underlying

The feature field is further accumulated into a 2D feature map as the textural

  To address these challenges, we begin by analyzing visibility statistics for

Hence we employ only a rough volumetric representation using a pose-conditioned
downsampled neural radiance field (PD-NeRF), which we can render efficiently at
low resolutions. In addition, we learn 2D textural features that are fused with
rendered volumetric features in image space. The key advantage of our approach

spatially-varying blur kernels by deforming a canonical sparse kernel at each

not need multi-view data to achieve this goal. Specifically, we show that by
reconstructing many images aligned to an approximate canonical pose with a
single network conditioned on a shared latent space, you can learn a space of
radiance fields that models shape and appearance for a class of objects. We
demonstrate this by training models to reconstruct object categories using

volume rendering -- to learn 3D object models that can be rendered
realistically from small numbers of images. In contrast to all previous NeRF
methods, DIVeR uses deterministic rather than stochastic estimates of the
volume rendering integral. DIVeR's representation is a voxel based field of
features. To compute the volume rendering integral, a ray is broken into
intervals, one per voxel; components of the volume rendering integral are
estimated from the features for each interval using an MLP, and the components
are aggregated. As a result, DIVeR can render thin translucent structures that
are missed by other integrators. Furthermore, DIVeR's representation has
semantics that is relatively exposed compared to other such methods -- moving
feature vectors around in the voxel space results in natural edits. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative comparisons to current state-of-the-art methods
show that DIVeR produces models that (1) render at or above state-of-the-art
quality, (2) are very small without being baked, (3) render very fast without

fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. Neural approaches such as
NeRF have achieved remarkable success in view synthesis, but do not explicitly
perform decomposition and instead operate exclusively on radiance (the product
of reflectance and illumination). Extensions to NeRF, such as NeRD, can perform
decomposition but struggle to accurately recover detailed illumination, thereby
significantly limiting realism. We propose a novel reflectance decomposition
network that can estimate shape, BRDF, and per-image illumination given a set
of object images captured under varying illumination. Our key technique is a
novel illumination integration network called Neural-PIL that replaces a costly
illumination integral operation in the rendering with a simple network query.
In addition, we also learn deep low-dimensional priors on BRDF and illumination
representations using novel smooth manifold auto-encoders. Our decompositions
can result in considerably better BRDF and light estimates enabling more
accurate novel view-synthesis and relighting compared to prior art. Project

majority of real-world scenes are composed of well-defined surfaces, we
introduce a surface analog of such implicit models called Neural Reflectance
Surfaces (NeRS). NeRS learns a neural shape representation of a closed surface

Even more importantly, surface parameterizations allow NeRS to learn (neural)
bidirectional surface reflectance functions (BRDFs) that factorize
view-dependent appearance into environmental illumination, diffuse color

matching pixels in indoor scenes. The key to our approach is to utilize the
learning-based priors to guide the optimization process of NeRF. Our system
firstly adapts a monocular depth network over the target scene by finetuning on
its sparse SfM+MVS reconstruction from COLMAP. Then, we show that the
shape-radiance ambiguity of NeRF still exists in indoor environments and
propose to address the issue by employing the adapted depth priors to monitor
the sampling process of volume rendering. Finally, a per-pixel confidence map
acquired by error computation on the rendered image can be used to further
improve the depth quality. Experiments show that our proposed framework
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on indoor scenes, with
surprising findings presented on the effectiveness of correspondence-based
optimization and NeRF-based optimization over the adapted depth priors. In
addition, we show that the guided optimization scheme does not sacrifice the
original synthesis capability of neural radiance fields, improving the
rendering quality on both seen and novel views. Code is available at

This requires learning the geometry of the scene, and we use Neural Radiance

training an SDDF model without 3D shape supervision, using only distance

directly predicting distance at arbitrary locations and viewing directions.
Unlike deep view-synthesis techniques, such as Neural Radiance Fields, which

incorrect geometries when given an insufficient number of input views. One
potential reason is that standard volumetric rendering does not enforce the
constraint that most of a scene's geometry consist of empty space and opaque
surfaces. We formalize the above assumption through DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised
Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning radiance fields that takes
advantage of readily-available depth supervision. We leverage the fact that
current NeRF pipelines require images with known camera poses that are
typically estimated by running structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also
produces sparse 3D points that can be used as ""free"" depth supervision during
training: we add a loss to encourage the distribution of a ray's terminating
depth matches a given 3D keypoint, incorporating depth uncertainty. DS-NeRF can
render better images given fewer training views while training 2-3x faster.
Further, we show that our loss is compatible with other recently proposed NeRF

topological changes require a discontinuity in the deformation field, but these

bias) for surface reconstruction, and therefore propose a new formulation that

Storage of such a 3D scene can be done in two ways; (1) storing 2D images taken
from the 3D scene that can reconstruct the scene back through interpolations,
or (2) storing a representation of the 3D scene itself that already encodes
views from all directions. So far, traditional 3D compression methods have
focused on the first type of storage and compressed the original 2D images with
image compression techniques. With this approach, the user first decodes the
stored 2D images and then renders the 3D scene. However, this separated
procedure is inefficient since a large amount of 2D images have to be stored.
In this work, we take a different approach and compress a functional
representation of 3D scenes. In particular, we introduce a method to compress
3D scenes by compressing the neural networks that represent the scenes as

model from a multi-view video. Some recent works have proposed to decompose a
non-rigidly deforming scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of
deformation fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space,
thereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they
represent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field,
which makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these

introduce neural blend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based
on the skeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D human
skeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observation
correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can
regularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blend
weight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate new
deformation fields to animate the human model. Experiments show that our

visual perception for large dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, in this paper we
propose the first approach for editable photo-realistic free-viewpoint video
generation for large-scale dynamic scenes using only sparse 16 cameras. The
core of our approach is a new layered neural representation, where each dynamic
entity including the environment itself is formulated into a space-time
coherent neural layered radiance representation called ST-NeRF. Such layered
representation supports fully perception and realistic manipulation of the
dynamic scene whilst still supporting a free viewing experience in a wide
range. In our ST-NeRF, the dynamic entity/layer is represented as continuous
functions, which achieves the disentanglement of location, deformation as well
as the appearance of the dynamic entity in a continuous and self-supervised
manner. We propose a scene parsing 4D label map tracking to disentangle the
spatial information explicitly, and a continuous deform module to disentangle
the temporal motion implicitly. An object-aware volume rendering scheme is
further introduced for the re-assembling of all the neural layers. We adopt a
novel layered loss and motion-aware ray sampling strategy to enable efficient
training for a large dynamic scene with multiple performers, Our framework
further enables a variety of editing functions, i.e., manipulating the scale

reconstruction loss. To accommodate for changing light source conditions both
from a directional light source (the Sun) and a diffuse light source (the sky),
we extend the NeRF approach in two ways. First, direct illumination from the
Sun is modeled via a local light source visibility field. Second, indirect
illumination from a diffuse light source is learned as a non-local color field

fields from only three nearby input views via fast network inference. Our
approach leverages plane-swept cost volumes (widely used in multi-view stereo)
for geometry-aware scene reasoning, and combines this with physically based
volume rendering for neural radiance field reconstruction. We train our network
on real objects in the DTU dataset, and test it on three different datasets to
evaluate its effectiveness and generalizability. Our approach can generalize
across scenes (even indoor scenes, completely different from our training
scenes of objects) and generate realistic view synthesis results using only
three input images, significantly outperforming concurrent works on
generalizable radiance field reconstruction. Moreover, if dense images are
captured, our estimated radiance field representation can be easily fine-tuned;

require rough camera poses initialization. Differently, our GNeRF only utilizes
randomly initialized poses for complex outside-in scenarios. We propose a novel
two-phases end-to-end framework. The first phase takes the use of GANs into the

the second phase refines them with additional photometric loss. We overcome
local minima using a hybrid and iterative optimization scheme. Extensive

the scene, thus smaller and faster-to-evaluate MLPs can be used. By combining
this divide-and-conquer strategy with further optimizations, rendering is

using PlenOctrees, an octree-based 3D representation which supports
view-dependent effects. Our method can render 800x800 images at more than 150
FPS, which is over 3000 times faster than conventional NeRFs. We do so without
sacrificing quality while preserving the ability of NeRFs to perform
free-viewpoint rendering of scenes with arbitrary geometry and view-dependent
effects. Real-time performance is achieved by pre-tabulating the NeRF into a
PlenOctree. In order to preserve view-dependent effects such as specularities,
we factorize the appearance via closed-form spherical basis functions.
Specifically, we show that it is possible to train NeRFs to predict a spherical
harmonic representation of radiance, removing the viewing direction as an input
to the neural network. Furthermore, we show that PlenOctrees can be directly
optimized to further minimize the reconstruction loss, which leads to equal or
better quality compared to competing methods. Moreover, this octree
optimization step can be used to reduce the training time, as we no longer need
to wait for the NeRF training to converge fully. Our real-time neural rendering
approach may potentially enable new applications such as 6-DOF industrial and

NeRF, shows that there is immense potential for implicitly storing high-quality

limitation preventing the use of NeRF in real-time rendering applications is
the prohibitive computational cost of excessive network evaluations along each

representations closer to practical rendering of synthetic content in real-time
applications, such as games and virtual reality. We show that the number of
samples required for each view ray can be significantly reduced when samples
are placed around surfaces in the scene without compromising image quality. To
this end, we propose a depth oracle network that predicts ray sample locations
for each view ray with a single network evaluation. We show that using a
classification network around logarithmically discretized and spherically
warped depth values is essential to encode surface locations rather than
directly estimating depth. The combination of these techniques leads to DONeRF,
our compact dual network design with a depth oracle network as its first step

reduce the inference costs by up to 48x compared to NeRF when conditioning on

representation. We show that a single handheld consumer-grade camera is
sufficient to synthesize sophisticated renderings of a dynamic scene from novel
virtual camera views, e.g. a `bullet-time' video effect. NR-NeRF disentangles
the dynamic scene into a canonical volume and its deformation. Scene
deformation is implemented as ray bending, where straight rays are deformed
non-rigidly. We also propose a novel rigidity network to better constrain rigid
regions of the scene, leading to more stable results. The ray bending and
rigidity network are trained without explicit supervision. Our formulation
enables dense correspondence estimation across views and time, and compelling
video editing applications such as motion exaggeration. Our code will be open

telepresence systems, virtual shopping, synthetic data generation, and more.
Recently, neural rendering methods, which combine techniques from computer
graphics and machine learning, have created high-fidelity models of humans and
objects. Some of these methods do not produce results with high-enough fidelity
for driveable human models (Neural Volumes) whereas others have extremely long
rendering times (NeRF). We propose a novel compositional 3D representation that
combines the best of previous methods to produce both higher-resolution and
faster results. Our representation bridges the gap between discrete and
continuous volumetric representations by combining a coarse 3D-structure-aware
grid of animation codes with a continuous learned scene function that maps
every position and its corresponding local animation code to its view-dependent
emitted radiance and local volume density. Differentiable volume rendering is
employed to compute photo-realistic novel views of the human head and upper
body as well as to train our novel representation end-to-end using only 2D
supervision. In addition, we show that the learned dynamic radiance field can
be used to synthesize novel unseen expressions based on a global animation

hard to generalize to new scenarios, including new lighting or new arrangements

propose to learn object-centric neural scattering functions (OSFs), a
representation that models per-object light transport implicitly using a
lighting- and view-dependent neural network. This enables rendering scenes even
when objects or lights move, without retraining. Combined with a volumetric
path tracing procedure, our framework is capable of rendering both intra- and

remarkably effective for the task of view synthesis - synthesizing
photorealistic novel views of real-world scenes or objects. In this work, we
investigate whether we can apply analysis-by-synthesis via NeRF for mesh-free,
RGB-only 6DoF pose estimation - given an image, find the translation and
rotation of a camera relative to a 3D object or scene. Our method assumes that
no object mesh models are available during either training or test time.
Starting from an initial pose estimate, we use gradient descent to minimize the
residual between pixels rendered from a NeRF and pixels in an observed image.
In our experiments, we first study 1) how to sample rays during pose refinement
for iNeRF to collect informative gradients and 2) how different batch sizes of
rays affect iNeRF on a synthetic dataset. We then show that for complex
real-world scenes from the LLFF dataset, iNeRF can improve NeRF by estimating
the camera poses of novel images and using these images as additional training

scene representation conditioned on one or few input images. The existing
approach for constructing neural radiance fields involves optimizing the
representation to every scene independently, requiring many calibrated views
and significant compute time. We take a step towards resolving these
shortcomings by introducing an architecture that conditions a NeRF on image
inputs in a fully convolutional manner. This allows the network to be trained
across multiple scenes to learn a scene prior, enabling it to perform novel
view synthesis in a feed-forward manner from a sparse set of views (as few as

reasoning have arisen as one of the most promising approaches for synthesizing
novel views of a scene from a sparse set of images. Among these, stands out the
Neural radiance fields (NeRF), which trains a deep network to map 5D input
coordinates (representing spatial location and viewing direction) into a volume
density and view-dependent emitted radiance. However, despite achieving an
unprecedented level of photorealism on the generated images, NeRF is only
applicable to static scenes, where the same spatial location can be queried
from different images. In this paper we introduce D-NeRF, a method that extends
neural radiance fields to a dynamic domain, allowing to reconstruct and render
novel images of objects under rigid and non-rigid motions from a \emph{single}
camera moving around the scene. For this purpose we consider time as an
additional input to the system, and split the learning process in two main
stages: one that encodes the scene into a canonical space and another that maps
this canonical representation into the deformed scene at a particular time.
Both mappings are simultaneously learned using fully-connected networks. Once
the networks are trained, D-NeRF can render novel images, controlling both the
camera view and the time variable, and thus, the object movement. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on scenes with objects under
rigid, articulated and non-rigid motions. Code, model weights and the dynamic

based on spatial decomposition capable of mitigating this issue. Our key
observation is that there are diminishing returns in employing larger (deeper

dedicate smaller networks for each decomposed part. When working together,
these networks can render the whole scene. This allows us near-constant
inference time regardless of the number of decomposed parts. Moreover, we show
that a Voronoi spatial decomposition is preferable for this purpose, as it is
provably compatible with the Painter's Algorithm for efficient and GPU-friendly
rendering. Our experiments show that for real-world scenes, our method provides

computer graphics techniques is challenging, because it requires the difficult
step of capturing detailed appearance and geometry models. Recent studies have
demonstrated promising results by learning scene representations that
implicitly encode both geometry and appearance without 3D supervision. However,
existing approaches in practice often show blurry renderings caused by the
limited network capacity or the difficulty in finding accurate intersections of
camera rays with the scene geometry. Synthesizing high-resolution imagery from
these representations often requires time-consuming optical ray marching. In
this work, we introduce Neural Sparse Voxel Fields (NSVF), a new neural scene
representation for fast and high-quality free-viewpoint rendering. NSVF defines
a set of voxel-bounded implicit fields organized in a sparse voxel octree to
model local properties in each cell. We progressively learn the underlying
voxel structures with a differentiable ray-marching operation from only a set
of posed RGB images. With the sparse voxel octree structure, rendering novel

frame against erasures is to examine the worst case condition number of the
frame with a certain number of vectors erased from the frame. The term {\em
numerically erasure-robust frames (NERFs)} was introduced in \cite{FicMix12} to
give a more precise characterization of erasure robustness of frames. In the
paper the authors established that random frames whose entries are drawn
independently from the standard normal distribution can be robust against up to
approximately 15\% erasures, and asked whether there exist frames that are
robust against erasures of more than 50\%. In this paper we show that with very
high probability random frames are, independent of the dimension, robust
against any amount of erasures as long as the number of remaining vectors is at
least $1+\delta$ times the dimension for some $\delta_0>0$. This is the best
possible result, and it also implies that the proportion of erasures can
arbitrarily close to 1 while still maintaining robustness. Our result depends

construct matrices with the restricted isometry property (RIP) whose
performance rivals those generated using random matrix theory. In short, RIP

low-dimensional examples. In this paper, we consider a similar problem
involving submatrix singular value estimation, namely the problem of explicitly
constructing numerically erasure robust frames (NERFs). Such frames are the
latest invention in a long line of research concerning the design of linear
encoders that are robust against data loss. We begin by focusing on a subtle
difference between the definition of a NERF and that of an RIP matrix, one that

bounds. In short, we estimate these bounds by evaluating the frame analysis
operator at every point of an epsilon-net for the unit sphere. We then borrow
ideas from the theory of group frames to construct explicit frames and
epsilon-nets with such high degrees of symmetry that the requisite number of
operator evaluations is greatly reduced. We conclude with numerical results,
using these new ideas to quickly produce decent estimates of NERF bounds which
