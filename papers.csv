lifelike 3D talking heads. However, due to the difficulty in fitting steep
appearance changes, the prevailing paradigm that presents facial motions by
directly modifying point appearance may lead to distortions in dynamic regions.
To tackle this challenge, we introduce TalkingGaussian, a deformation-based
radiance fields framework for high-fidelity talking head synthesis. Leveraging
the point-based Gaussian Splatting, facial motions can be represented in our
method by applying smooth and continuous deformations to persistent Gaussian
primitives, without requiring to learn the difficult appearance change like
previous methods. Due to this simplification, precise facial motions can be
synthesized while keeping a highly intact facial feature. Under such a
deformation paradigm, we further identify a face-mouth motion inconsistency
that would affect the learning of detailed speaking motions. To address this
conflict, we decompose the model into two branches separately for the face and
inside mouth areas, therefore simplifying the learning tasks to help
reconstruct more accurate motion and structure of the mouth region. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method renders high-quality lip-synchronized
talking head videos, with better facial fidelity and higher efficiency compared
with previous methods.";Jiahe Li<author:sep>Jiawei Zhang<author:sep>Xiao Bai<author:sep>Jin Zheng<author:sep>Xin Ning<author:sep>Jun Zhou<author:sep>Lin Gu;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15264v1;cs.CV;Project page: https://fictionarry.github.io/TalkingGaussian/;gaussian splatting

solves for precise camera poses, camera intrinsics, and per-frame dense depth
of a video sequence. Our method performs per-video gradient-descent
minimization of a simple least-squares objective that compares the optical flow
induced by depth, intrinsics, and poses against correspondences obtained via
off-the-shelf optical flow and point tracking. Alongside the use of point
tracks to encourage long-term geometric consistency, we introduce
differentiable re-parameterizations of depth, intrinsics, and pose that are
amenable to first-order optimization. We empirically show that camera
parameters and dense depth recovered by our method enable photo-realistic novel
view synthesis on 360-degree trajectories using Gaussian Splatting. Our method
not only far outperforms prior gradient-descent based bundle adjustment
methods, but surprisingly performs on par with COLMAP, the state-of-the-art SfM
method, on the downstream task of 360-degree novel view synthesis (even though
our method is purely gradient-descent based, fully differentiable, and presents
a complete departure from conventional SfM).";Cameron Smith<author:sep>David Charatan<author:sep>Ayush Tewari<author:sep>Vincent Sitzmann;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15259v1;cs.CV;Project website: https://cameronosmith.github.io/flowmap/;gaussian splatting

3D scene reconstruction. However, NeRF heavily relies on precise camera poses.
While recent works like BARF have introduced camera pose optimization within
NeRF, their applicability is limited to simple trajectory scenes. Existing
methods struggle while tackling complex trajectories involving large rotations.
To address this limitation, we propose CT-NeRF, an incremental reconstruction
optimization pipeline using only RGB images without pose and depth input. In
this pipeline, we first propose a local-global bundle adjustment under a pose
graph connecting neighboring frames to enforce the consistency between poses to
escape the local minima caused by only pose consistency with the scene
structure. Further, we instantiate the consistency between poses as a
reprojected geometric image distance constraint resulting from pixel-level
correspondences between input image pairs. Through the incremental
reconstruction, CT-NeRF enables the recovery of both camera poses and scene
structure and is capable of handling scenes with complex trajectories. We
evaluate the performance of CT-NeRF on two real-world datasets, NeRFBuster and
Free-Dataset, which feature complex trajectories. Results show CT-NeRF

Fields (NeRF) have achieved impressive results. However, due to inadequate pose

novel method for audio-driven talking head synthesis based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting. With the explicit representation property of 3D Gaussians, intuitive
control of the facial motion is achieved by binding Gaussians to 3D facial
models. GaussianTalker consists of two modules, Speaker-specific Motion
Translator and Dynamic Gaussian Renderer. Speaker-specific Motion Translator
achieves accurate lip movements specific to the target speaker through
universalized audio feature extraction and customized lip motion generation.
Dynamic Gaussian Renderer introduces Speaker-specific BlendShapes to enhance
facial detail representation via a latent pose, delivering stable and realistic
rendered videos. Extensive experimental results suggest that GaussianTalker
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in talking head synthesis,

dynamic humans in 3D from a monocular video input. As a key idea, we represent
both the world and multiple humans via the recently emerging 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3D-GS) representation, enabling to conveniently and efficiently
compose and render them together. In particular, we address the scenarios with
severely limited and sparse observations in 3D human reconstruction, a common
challenge encountered in the real world. To tackle this challenge, we introduce
a novel approach to optimize the 3D-GS representation in a canonical space by
fusing the sparse cues in the common space, where we leverage a pre-trained 2D
diffusion model to synthesize unseen views while keeping the consistency with
the observed 2D appearances. We demonstrate our method can reconstruct
high-quality animatable 3D humans in various challenging examples, in the
presence of occlusion, image crops, few-shot, and extremely sparse
observations. After reconstruction, our method is capable of not only rendering
the scene in any novel views at arbitrary time instances, but also editing the

synthesis of novel views in 3D scenes. Currently, it primarily focuses on
geometry and appearance modeling, while lacking the semantic understanding of
scenes. To bridge this gap, we present CLIP-GS, which integrates semantics from
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) into Gaussian Splatting to
efficiently comprehend 3D environments without annotated semantic data. In
specific, rather than straightforwardly learning and rendering high-dimensional
semantic features of 3D Gaussians, which significantly diminishes the
efficiency, we propose a Semantic Attribute Compactness (SAC) approach. SAC
exploits the inherent unified semantics within objects to learn compact yet
effective semantic representations of 3D Gaussians, enabling highly efficient
rendering (>100 FPS). Additionally, to address the semantic ambiguity, caused
by utilizing view-inconsistent 2D CLIP semantics to supervise Gaussians, we
introduce a 3D Coherent Self-training (3DCS) strategy, resorting to the
multi-view consistency originated from the 3D model. 3DCS imposes cross-view
semantic consistency constraints by leveraging refined, self-predicted
pseudo-labels derived from the trained 3D Gaussian model, thereby enhancing
precise and view-consistent segmentation results. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method remarkably outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving improvements of 17.29% and 20.81% in mIoU metric on

3D-aware GAN to tackle this problem. In this framework, we utilize an
expressive generator to synthesize stylized faces and a triple-branch
discriminator module to improve the visual quality and style consistency of the
generated faces. Specifically, a style encoder based on contrastive learning is
leveraged to extract robust low-dimensional embeddings of style images,
empowering the generator with the knowledge of various styles. To smooth the
training process of cross-domain transfer learning, we propose an adaptive
style blending module which helps inject style information and allows users to
freely tune the level of stylization. We further introduce a neural rendering
module to achieve efficient real-time rendering of images with higher

restoration in terms of both geometry and texture. Our methodology begins with
optimizing the positioning of Gaussian primitives to improve geometric

employ a novel feature propagation mechanism to bolster texture coherence,
leveraging a cross-attention design that bridges sampling Gaussians from both

diagnostic assistance, such as biopsy, and facilitating surgical navigation,
particularly in polyp detection. Computer-assisted endoscopic surgery has

  However, the inadequate tissue texture representation and confused scale

our system makes use of NeRF's implicit loop closure correction capability.
This improves the tracking accuracy by reinforcing the constraints on the

by implementing a feature-based and uniform sampling strategy that minimizes
the number of ineffective constraint points for pose optimization, we mitigate
the effects of random sampling in NeRF. EC-SLAM utilizes sparse parametric

the main performance bottlenecks are both algorithmic and architectural. We
introduce, CICERO, to tame both forms of inefficiencies. We first introduce two
algorithms, one fundamentally reduces the amount of work any NeRF model has to
execute, and the other eliminates irregular DRAM accesses. We then describe an
on-chip data layout strategy that eliminates SRAM bank conflicts. A pure
software implementation of CICERO offers an 8.0x speed-up and 7.9x energy

a novel coarse-to-fine tracking model tailored for Neural Radiance Field SLAM

NeRF-SLAM systems consistently exhibit inferior tracking performance compared
to traditional SLAM algorithms. NeRF-SLAM methods solve camera tracking via
image alignment and photometric bundle-adjustment. Such optimization processes
are difficult to optimize due to the narrow basin of attraction of the
optimization loss in image space (local minima) and the lack of initial
correspondences. We mitigate these limitations by implementing a Gaussian
pyramid filter on top of NeRF, facilitating a coarse-to-fine tracking
optimization strategy. Furthermore, NeRF systems encounter challenges in
converging to the right geometry with limited input views. While prior
approaches use a Signed-Distance Function (SDF)-based NeRF and directly
supervise SDF values by approximating ground truth SDF through depth
measurements, this often results in suboptimal geometry. In contrast, our

regularizer on the ray termination distribution, constraining scene geometry to
consist of empty space and opaque surfaces. Our solution implements both local

To address this problem, we propose Super-Resolution 3D Gaussian Splatting

sub-pixel constraint is introduced for the increased viewpoints in HR space,
exploiting the sub-pixel cross-view information of the multiple low-resolution

rendering by rasterizing Gaussian ellipsoids. However, Gaussian splatting
utilizes a single Spherical Harmonic (SH) function to model both texture and
lighting, limiting independent editing capabilities of these components.
Recently, attempts have been made to decouple texture and lighting with the
Gaussian splatting representation but may fail to produce plausible geometry
and decomposition results on reflective scenes. Additionally, the forward
shading technique they employ introduces noticeable blending artifacts during
relighting, as the geometry attributes of Gaussians are optimized under the
original illumination and may not be suitable for novel lighting conditions. To
address these issues, we introduce DeferredGS, a method for decoupling and
editing the Gaussian splatting representation using deferred shading. To
achieve successful decoupling, we model the illumination with a learnable
environment map and define additional attributes such as texture parameters and
normal direction on Gaussians, where the normal is distilled from a jointly

provides priors of spare 2D points and ILM utilizes these sparse points to
render patches with sparse NeRFs for matching. This allows us to discard a
large number of 2D descriptors so as to reduce the map size. Moreover,
rendering patches only for useful points rather than all pixels in the whole
image reduces the rendering time significantly. This framework inherits the

potent prior of Diffusion Models from text-to-image generation into the 3D

DreamScape, a method for creating highly consistent 3D scenes solely from
textual descriptions, leveraging the strong 3D representation capabilities of
Gaussian Splatting and the complex arrangement abilities of large language
models (LLMs). Our approach involves a 3D Gaussian Guide ($3{DG^2}$) for scene
representation, consisting of semantic primitives (objects) and their spatial
transformations and relationships derived directly from text prompts using
LLMs. This compositional representation allows for local-to-global optimization
of the entire scene. A progressive scale control is tailored during local
object generation, ensuring that objects of different sizes and densities adapt
to the scene, which addresses training instability issue arising from simple
blending in the subsequent global optimization stage. To mitigate potential
biases of LLM priors, we model collision relationships between objects at the
global level, enhancing physical correctness and overall realism. Additionally,
to generate pervasive objects like rain and snow distributed extensively across
the scene, we introduce a sparse initialization and densification strategy.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Edge Guided Gaussian Splatting (EGGS)

the edge region a higher weight than the flat region. With such edge guidance,
the resulting Gaussian particles focus more on the edges instead of the flat

autoencoder tailored for 3D Gaussian to project it into feature space. To
maintain the local continuity of the scene, we devise SuperGaussian for
clustering based on the acquired features. By calculating the similarity
between clusters and employing a two-stage estimation method, we derive an
Eulerian motion field to describe velocities across the entire scene. The 3D

method for dynamic view synthesis. Existing neural radiance fields (NeRF) based
solutions learn the deformation in an implicit manner, which cannot incorporate
3D scene geometry. Therefore, the learned deformation is not necessarily
geometrically coherent, which results in unsatisfactory dynamic view synthesis
and 3D dynamic reconstruction. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting provides a new
representation of the 3D scene, building upon which the 3D geometry could be
exploited in learning the complex 3D deformation. Specifically, the scenes are
represented as a collection of 3D Gaussian, where each 3D Gaussian is optimized
to move and rotate over time to model the deformation. To enforce the 3D scene
geometry constraint during deformation, we explicitly extract 3D geometry
features and integrate them in learning the 3D deformation. In this way, our
solution achieves 3D geometry-aware deformation modeling, which enables
improved dynamic view synthesis and 3D dynamic reconstruction. Extensive
experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets prove the superiority
of our solution, which achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

face critical limitations, including a limited field of view and a lack of
depth information, which can impede the detection of precancerous lesions.
Current methods struggle to provide comprehensive and accurate 3D
reconstructions of the colonic surface which can help minimize the missing
regions and reinspection for pre-cancerous polyps. Addressing this, we
introduce 'Gaussian Pancakes', a method that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3D GS) combined with a Recurrent Neural Network-based Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (RNNSLAM) system. By introducing geometric and depth
regularization into the 3D GS framework, our approach ensures more accurate
alignment of Gaussians with the colon surface, resulting in smoother 3D
reconstructions with novel viewing of detailed textures and structures.
Evaluations across three diverse datasets show that Gaussian Pancakes enhances
novel view synthesis quality, surpassing current leading methods with a 18%
boost in PSNR and a 16% improvement in SSIM. It also delivers over 100X faster

creation has made significant progress recently. One promising solution
involves the fine-tuning of pre-trained 2D diffusion models to harness their
capacity for producing multi-view images, which are then lifted into accurate
3D models via methods like fast-NeRFs or large reconstruction models. However,
as inconsistency still exists and limited generated resolution, the generation

To solve this problem, we propose Magic-Boost, a multi-view conditioned

adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this progress, the cumbersome
optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle to efficiency. In this
paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for 3D generation without
model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map redundancy is
prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion time-steps in
close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature maps across
neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model's inference in 3D
generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing.
Surprisingly, this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation
but also enhances the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D
objects. Our experiments covering 5 text-to-3D and 3 image-to-3D models,
demonstrate Hash3D's versatility to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency
by 1.3 to 4 times. Additionally, Hash3D's integration with 3D Gaussian
splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing text-to-3D processing

dynamic scenes from monocular videos. In contrast to previous NeRF methods that
reconstruct dynamic scenes from the colors and volume densities of individual
points, Semantic Flow learns semantics from continuous flows that contain rich
3D motion information. As there is 2D-to-3D ambiguity problem in the viewing
direction when extracting 3D flow features from 2D video frames, we consider
the volume densities as opacity priors that describe the contributions of flow
features to the semantics on the frames. More specifically, we first learn a
flow network to predict flows in the dynamic scene, and propose a flow feature
aggregation module to extract flow features from video frames. Then, we propose
a flow attention module to extract motion information from flow features, which
is followed by a semantic network to output semantic logits of flows. We
integrate the logits with volume densities in the viewing direction to
supervise the flow features with semantic labels on video frames. Experimental
results show that our model is able to learn from multiple dynamic scenes and
supports a series of new tasks such as instance-level scene editing, semantic
completions, dynamic scene tracking and semantic adaption on novel scenes.

and more important, among which, stylization is an important tool of 3D
appearance editing. It can achieve consistent 3D artistic stylization given a
single reference style image and thus is a user-friendly editing way. However,
recent NeRF-based 3D stylization methods face efficiency issues that affect the
actual user experience and the implicit nature limits its ability to transfer

flexible control over stylized scenes is considered highly desirable, fostering
an environment conducive to creative exploration. In this paper, we introduce
StylizedGS, a 3D neural style transfer framework with adaptable control over
perceptual factors based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation. The
3DGS brings the benefits of high efficiency. We propose a GS filter to
eliminate floaters in the reconstruction which affects the stylization effects
before stylization. Then the nearest neighbor-based style loss is introduced to
achieve stylization by fine-tuning the geometry and color parameters of 3DGS,
while a depth preservation loss with other regularizations is proposed to
prevent the tampering of geometry content. Moreover, facilitated by specially
designed losses, StylizedGS enables users to control color, stylized scale and
regions during the stylization to possess customized capabilities. Our method

when only sparse input views are available, pre-trained few-shot NeRFs often
suffer from high-frequency artifacts, which are generated as a by-product of
high-frequency details for improving reconstruction quality. Is it possible to
generate more faithful stylized scenes from sparse inputs by directly
optimizing encoding-based scene representation with target style? In this

disentangling content semantics and style textures. We propose a coarse-to-fine
sparse-view scene stylization framework, where a novel hierarchical
encoding-based neural representation is designed to generate high-quality
stylized scenes directly from implicit scene representations. We also propose a

poses, yet many datasets suffer from inaccuracies in pose metadata. Also, the
standard approach of NeRF is ill-suited for the distinct characteristics of

This goes beyond the traditional closed-set assumption, i.e., where models can

This is similar in spirit to LERF, however our work shows that using pixel-wise

  We propose a novel approach for surface reconstruction from Gaussian
splatting models. Rather than relying on the Gaussian elements' locations as a

render pairs of stereo-calibrated novel views from which we extract depth
profiles using a stereo matching method. We then combine the extracted RGB-D

more accurate and shows finer details when compared to other methods for
surface reconstruction from Gaussian splatting models, while requiring
significantly less compute time compared to other surface reconstruction
methods.

progress in quality and speed recently. One of its dominant paradigms involves
generating consistent multi-view images followed by a sparse-view
reconstruction. However, due to the challenge of directly deforming the mesh
representation to approach the target topology, most methodologies learn an
implicit representation (such as NeRF) during the sparse-view reconstruction
and acquire the target mesh by a post-processing extraction. Although the
implicit representation can effectively model rich 3D information, its training
typically entails a long convergence time. In addition, the post-extraction
operation from the implicit field also leads to undesirable visual artifacts.
In this paper, we propose FlexiDreamer, a novel single image-to-3d generation
framework that reconstructs the target mesh in an end-to-end manner. By
leveraging a flexible gradient-based extraction known as FlexiCubes, our method
circumvents the defects brought by the post-processing and facilitates a direct
acquisition of the target mesh. Furthermore, we incorporate a multi-resolution
hash grid encoding scheme that progressively activates the encoding levels into
the implicit field in FlexiCubes to help capture geometric details for per-step

unknown environment as a two-player zero-sum game: the agent aims to maximize
information gained from the environment while the environment aims to minimize
the information gained by the agent. In each episode, the environment reveals a
set of actions with their potentially erroneous information gain. In order to
select the best action, the robot needs to recover the true information gain
from the erroneous one. The robot does so by minimizing the discrepancy between
its estimate of information gain and the true information gain it observes

achieved by fine-tuning a pretrained text-to-image model with a small

achieved by layout-conditioned depth estimation and neural radiance fields

Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), namely 3DGSR, that allows for accurate 3D
reconstruction with intricate details while inheriting the high efficiency and
rendering quality of 3DGS. The key insight is incorporating an implicit signed
distance field (SDF) within 3D Gaussians to enable them to be aligned and
jointly optimized. First, we introduce a differentiable SDF-to-opacity
transformation function that converts SDF values into corresponding Gaussians'
opacities. This function connects the SDF and 3D Gaussians, allowing for
unified optimization and enforcing surface constraints on the 3D Gaussians.
During learning, optimizing the 3D Gaussians provides supervisory signals for
SDF learning, enabling the reconstruction of intricate details. However, this
only provides sparse supervisory signals to the SDF at locations occupied by
Gaussians, which is insufficient for learning a continuous SDF. Then, to
address this limitation, we incorporate volumetric rendering and align the
rendered geometric attributes (depth, normal) with those derived from 3D
Gaussians. This consistency regularization introduces supervisory signals to
locations not covered by discrete 3D Gaussians, effectively eliminating
redundant surfaces outside the Gaussian sampling range. Our extensive

technique for recovering the underlying 3D scene representation from a single

recording of high-dimensional data, such as hyperspectral or temporal
information, into a single image using low-cost 2D imaging sensors. To achieve
this, a series of specially designed 2D masks are usually employed, which not

Inspired by this, to take one step further, our approach builds upon the
powerful 3D scene representation capabilities of neural radiance fields (NeRF).
Specifically, we formulate the physical imaging process of SCI as part of the

reconstruction and dense RGB-D SLAM systems. One notable development is the
application of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in these systems, which utilizes
implicit neural representation to encode 3D scenes. This extension of NeRF to
SLAM has shown promising results. However, the depth images obtained from
consumer-grade RGB-D sensors are often sparse and noisy, which poses
significant challenges for 3D reconstruction and affects the accuracy of the
representation of the scene geometry. Moreover, the original hierarchical

representation. Furthermore, the existing methods select random pixels for
camera tracking, which leads to inaccurate localization and is not robust in
real-world indoor environments. To this end, we present NeSLAM, an advanced
framework that achieves accurate and dense depth estimation, robust camera

denoising network is designed to provide dense geometry prior and guide the
neural implicit representation optimization. Second, the occupancy scene

a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline, a procedure that can be slow and
unreliable, particularly in sparse-view scenarios with insufficient matched
features for accurate reconstruction. In this work, we integrate the strengths
of point-based representations (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting, 3D-GS) with
end-to-end dense stereo models (DUSt3R) to tackle the complex yet unresolved
issues in NVS under unconstrained settings, which encompasses pose-free and
sparse view challenges. Our framework, InstantSplat, unifies dense stereo
priors with 3D-GS to build 3D Gaussians of large-scale scenes from sparseview &

Coarse Geometric Initialization (CGI) module that swiftly establishes a
preliminary scene structure and camera parameters across all training views,
utilizing globally-aligned 3D point maps derived from a pre-trained dense

training is affected by motion blur. On the other hand, event cameras excel in
dynamic scenes as they measure brightness changes with microsecond resolution
and are thus only marginally affected by blur. Recent methods attempt to
enhance NeRF reconstructions under camera motion by fusing frames and events.
However, they face challenges in recovering accurate color content or constrain
the NeRF to a set of predefined camera poses, harming reconstruction quality in
challenging conditions. This paper proposes a novel formulation addressing
these issues by leveraging both model- and learning-based modules. We
explicitly model the blur formation process, exploiting the event double
integral as an additional model-based prior. Additionally, we model the
event-pixel response using an end-to-end learnable response function, allowing

their position, and prevent them from moving independently during optimization.
Specifically, we introduce single and multiview constraints through an implicit
convolutional decoder and a total variation loss, respectively. With the
coherency introduced to the Gaussians, we further constrain the optimization

Splatting (SA-GS). While the state-of-the-art method Mip-Splatting needs
modifying the training procedure of Gaussian splatting, our method functions at
test-time and is training-free. Specifically, SA-GS can be applied to any
pretrained Gaussian splatting field as a plugin to significantly improve the
field's anti-alising performance. The core technique is to apply 2D
scale-adaptive filters to each Gaussian during test time. As pointed out by
Mip-Splatting, observing Gaussians at different frequencies leads to mismatches
between the Gaussian scales during training and testing. Mip-Splatting resolves
this issue using 3D smoothing and 2D Mip filters, which are unfortunately not
aware of testing frequency. In this work, we show that a 2D scale-adaptive
filter that is informed of testing frequency can effectively match the Gaussian
scale, thus making the Gaussian primitive distribution remain consistent across
different testing frequencies. When scale inconsistency is eliminated, sampling
rates smaller than the scene frequency result in conventional jaggedness, and
we propose to integrate the projected 2D Gaussian within each pixel during
testing. This integration is actually a limiting case of super-sampling, which
significantly improves anti-aliasing performance over vanilla Gaussian
Splatting. Through extensive experiments using various settings and both
bounded and unbounded scenes, we show SA-GS performs comparably with or better
than Mip-Splatting. Note that super-sampling and integration are only effective

photorealistic novel view synthesis when trained on dense inputs. However, when
trained on sparse inputs, NeRF typically encounters issues of incorrect density
or color predictions, mainly due to insufficient coverage of the scene causing
partial and sparse supervision, thus leading to significant performance
degradation. While existing works mainly consider ray-level consistency to
construct 2D learning regularization based on rendered color, depth, or
semantics on image planes, in this paper we propose a novel approach that
models 3D spatial field consistency to improve NeRF's performance with sparse
inputs. Specifically, we first adopt a voxel-based ray sampling strategy to
ensure that the sampled rays intersect with a certain voxel in 3D space. We
then randomly sample additional points within the voxel and apply a Transformer
to infer the properties of other points on each ray, which are then
incorporated into the volume rendering. By backpropagating through the
rendering loss, we enhance the consistency among neighboring points.
Additionally, we propose to use a contrastive loss on the encoder output of the
Transformer to further improve consistency within each voxel. Experiments

Sampling (SDS), which enables the zero-shot learning of implicit 3D models

However, current SDS-based models still struggle with intricate text prompts
and commonly result in distorted 3D models with unrealistic textures or
cross-view inconsistency issues. In this work, we introduce a novel Visual
Prompt-guided text-to-3D diffusion model (VP3D) that explicitly unleashes the
visual appearance knowledge in 2D visual prompt to boost text-to-3D generation.
Instead of solely supervising SDS with text prompt, VP3D first capitalizes on
2D diffusion model to generate a high-quality image from input text, which
subsequently acts as visual prompt to strengthen SDS optimization with explicit
visual appearance. Meanwhile, we couple the SDS optimization with additional
differentiable reward function that encourages rendering images of 3D models to
better visually align with 2D visual prompt and semantically match with text
prompt. Through extensive experiments, we show that the 2D Visual Prompt in our
VP3D significantly eases the learning of visual appearance of 3D models and
thus leads to higher visual fidelity with more detailed textures. It is also
appealing in view that when replacing the self-generating visual prompt with a

Current works either constrain the distribution of density fields or the shape

obtaining ground truth pose labels required for the training process remains a

views. In response to this challenge, we introduce WSCLoc, a system capable of
being customized to various deep learning-based relocalization models to
enhance their performance under weakly-supervised and sparse view conditions.
This is realized with two stages. In the initial stage, WSCLoc employs a
multilayer perceptron-based structure called WFT-NeRF to co-optimize image
reconstruction quality and initial pose information. To ensure a stable
learning process, we incorporate temporal information as input. Furthermore,
instead of optimizing SE(3), we opt for $\mathfrak{sim}(3)$ optimization to
explicitly enforce a scale constraint. In the second stage, we co-optimize the
pre-trained WFT-NeRF and WFT-Pose. This optimization is enhanced by
Time-Encoding based Random View Synthesis and supervised by inter-frame
geometric constraints that consider pose, depth, and RGB information. We
validate our approaches on two publicly available datasets, one outdoor and one
indoor. Our experimental results demonstrate that our weakly-supervised

mainly attributed to the point cloud growth condition in 3DGS that only
considers the average gradient magnitude of points from observable views,
thereby failing to grow for large Gaussians that are observable for many

we propose a novel method, named Pixel-GS, to take into account the number of
pixels covered by the Gaussian in each view during the computation of the

dynamically average the gradients from different views, such that the growth of
large Gaussians can be prompted. As a result, points within the areas with
insufficient initializing points can be grown more effectively, leading to a
more accurate and detailed reconstruction. In addition, we propose a simple yet
effective strategy to scale the gradient field according to the distance to the

large-scale scenes. However, their limited model capacity typically results in
blurred rendering results. Existing large-scale NeRFs primarily address this
limitation by partitioning the scene into blocks, which are subsequently
handled by separate sub-NeRFs. These sub-NeRFs, trained from scratch and
processed independently, lead to inconsistencies in geometry and appearance
across the scene. Consequently, the rendering quality fails to exhibit
significant improvement despite the expansion of model capacity. In this work,
we present global-guided focal neural radiance field (GF-NeRF) that achieves
high-fidelity rendering of large-scale scenes. Our proposed GF-NeRF utilizes a
two-stage (Global and Focal) architecture and a global-guided training
strategy. The global stage obtains a continuous representation of the entire
scene while the focal stage decomposes the scene into multiple blocks and
further processes them with distinct sub-encoders. Leveraging this two-stage
architecture, sub-encoders only need fine-tuning based on the global encoder,
thus reducing training complexity in the focal stage while maintaining
scene-wide consistency. Spatial information and error information from the
global stage also benefit the sub-encoders to focus on crucial areas and
effectively capture more details of large-scale scenes. Notably, our approach
does not rely on any prior knowledge about the target scene, attributing
GF-NeRF adaptable to various large-scale scene types, including street-view and
aerial-view scenes. We demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity,
natural rendering results on various types of large-scale datasets. Our project

transformation allows the capture of intricate texture details within a volume
composed of a fixed number of Gaussians. To better optimize the representation
of these details, we propose a unique pruning and densifying method named the

generation of GaussianVolume and empower the model to generate instances with
detailed 3D geometry, we propose a coarse-to-fine pipeline. It initially
constructs a basic geometric structure, followed by the prediction of complete

Moreover, for the prevalent deformation-based paradigm that presents a harder

state-of-the-art methods struggle to reconstruct high frequency detail, due to
factors such as a low-frequency bias of radiance fields and inaccurate camera

this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of neural scene

Specifically, we present four different strategies of how to incorporate a
second modality, other than RGB, into NeRFs: (1) training from scratch
independently on both modalities; (2) pre-training on RGB and fine-tuning on
the second modality; (3) adding a second branch; and (4) adding a separate

thermal imaging as second modality since it strongly differs from RGB in terms
of radiosity, making it challenging to integrate into neural scene

new publicly available multi-view dataset, ThermalMix, consisting of six common
objects and about 360 RGB and thermal images in total. We employ cross-modality
calibration prior to data capturing, leading to high-quality alignments between
RGB and thermal images. Our findings reveal that adding a second branch to NeRF

scales and cluttered shapes, 3D Gaussian splatting models can produce a blurred
or needle-like effect near the surface. At the same time, 3D Gaussian splatting
models tend to flatten large untextured regions, yielding a very sparse point
cloud. These problems are caused by the non-uniform nature of 3D Gaussian
splatting models, so in this paper, we propose a new 3D Gaussian splitting
algorithm, which can produce a more uniform and surface-bounded 3D Gaussian
splatting model. Our algorithm splits an $N$-dimensional Gaussian into two
N-dimensional Gaussians. It ensures consistency of mathematical characteristics
and similarity of appearance, allowing resulting 3D Gaussian splatting models
to be more uniform and a better fit to the underlying surface, and thus more
suitable for explicit editing, point cloud extraction and other tasks.

synthesis. Nonetheless, the task of generating high-quality images for novel
views persists as a critical challenge. While the existing efforts have
exhibited commendable progress, capturing intricate details, enhancing
textures, and achieving superior Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metrics
warrant further focused attention and advancement. In this work, we propose
NeRF-VPT, an innovative method for novel view synthesis to address these
challenges. Our proposed NeRF-VPT employs a cascading view prompt tuning
paradigm, wherein RGB information gained from preceding rendering outcomes
serves as instructive visual prompts for subsequent rendering stages, with the
aspiration that the prior knowledge embedded in the prompts can facilitate the
gradual enhancement of rendered image quality. NeRF-VPT only requires sampling
RGB data from previous stage renderings as priors at each training stage,
without relying on extra guidance or complex techniques. Thus, our NeRF-VPT is
plug-and-play and can be readily integrated into existing methods. By
conducting comparative analyses of our NeRF-VPT against several NeRF-based
approaches on demanding real-scene benchmarks, such as Realistic Synthetic 360,
Real Forward-Facing, Replica dataset, and a user-captured dataset, we
substantiate that our NeRF-VPT significantly elevates baseline performance and
proficiently generates more high-quality novel view images than all the
compared state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the cascading learning of
NeRF-VPT introduces adaptability to scenarios with sparse inputs, resulting in
a significant enhancement of accuracy for sparse-view novel view synthesis. The

coordinate-based continuous target values, such as RGB for Neural Radiance

some regression loss. However, are regression models really better than
classification models for neural field methods? In this work, we try to visit
this very fundamental but overlooked question for neural fields from a machine
learning perspective. We successfully propose a novel Neural Field Classifier
(NFC) framework which formulates existing neural field methods as
classification tasks rather than regression tasks. The proposed NFC can easily
transform arbitrary Neural Field Regressor (NFR) into its classification
variant via employing a novel Target Encoding module and optimizing a
classification loss. By encoding a continuous regression target into a
high-dimensional discrete encoding, we naturally formulate a multi-label

Real-time applications like XR apps and games require functions such as

texture space and re-projecting them back to world space through implicit shell
mapping, we show how our 3D modeling can serve as a valid rendering methodology
for interactive applications. It is further noted that recently, 3D mesh
reconstruction works have been able to produce high-quality mesh for rendering.
Our work, on the other hand, only requires an approximated geometry for
rendering an object in high fidelity. Applicationwise, we will show that our

techniques, using text prompts or even spatial controls. However, applying
these editing methods to multi-view images depicting a single scene leads to
3D-inconsistent results. In this work, we focus on spatial control-based
geometric manipulations and introduce a method to consolidate the editing
process across various views. We build on two insights: (1) maintaining
consistent features throughout the generative process helps attain consistency
in multi-view editing, and (2) the queries in self-attention layers
significantly influence the image structure. Hence, we propose to improve the
geometric consistency of the edited images by enforcing the consistency of the
queries. To do so, we introduce QNeRF, a neural radiance field trained on the
internal query features of the edited images. Once trained, QNeRF can render
3D-consistent queries, which are then softly injected back into the
self-attention layers during generation, greatly improving multi-view
consistency. We refine the process through a progressive, iterative method that
better consolidates queries across the diffusion timesteps. We compare our
method to a range of existing techniques and demonstrate that it can achieve
better multi-view consistency and higher fidelity to the input scene. These
advantages allow us to train NeRFs with fewer visual artifacts, that are better

3D-GS represents 3D scenes by utilizing millions of 3D Gaussians and projects
these Gaussians onto the 2D image plane for rendering. However, during the
rendering process, a substantial number of unnecessary 3D Gaussians exist for
the current view direction, resulting in significant computation costs
associated with their identification. In this paper, we propose a computational
reduction technique that quickly identifies unnecessary 3D Gaussians in
real-time for rendering the current view without compromising image quality.
This is accomplished through the offline clustering of 3D Gaussians that are
close in distance, followed by the projection of these clusters onto a 2D image
plane during runtime. Additionally, we analyze the bottleneck associated with
the proposed technique when executed on GPUs and propose an efficient hardware
architecture that seamlessly supports the proposed scheme. For the Mip-NeRF360

accelerated training and inference without a decrease in rendering quality by
encoding the object's characteristics in a collection of Gaussian

Radiance Fields, have demonstrated significant capabilities for reconstructing
surfaces with complicated geometry and topology, and generating novel views of
a scene. Nevertheless, it is challenging for users to directly deform or
manipulate these implicit representations with large deformations in the
real-time fashion. Gaussian Splatting(GS) has recently become a promising
method with explicit geometry for representing static scenes and facilitating
high-quality and real-time synthesis of novel views. However,it cannot be
easily deformed due to the use of discrete Gaussians and lack of explicit
topology. To address this, we develop a novel GS-based method that enables
interactive deformation. Our key idea is to design an innovative mesh-based GS
representation, which is integrated into Gaussian learning and manipulation. 3D
Gaussians are defined over an explicit mesh, and they are bound with each
other: the rendering of 3D Gaussians guides the mesh face split for adaptive
refinement, and the mesh face split directs the splitting of 3D Gaussians.
Moreover, the explicit mesh constraints help regularize the Gaussian
distribution, suppressing poor-quality Gaussians(e.g. misaligned
Gaussians,long-narrow shaped Gaussians), thus enhancing visual quality and
avoiding artifacts during deformation. Based on this representation, we further
introduce a large-scale Gaussian deformation technique to enable deformable GS,
which alters the parameters of 3D Gaussians according to the manipulation of
the associated mesh. Our method benefits from existing mesh deformation
datasets for more realistic data-driven Gaussian deformation. Extensive
experiments show that our approach achieves high-quality reconstruction and
effective deformation, while maintaining the promising rendering results at a

view-inconsistent semantics provided by CLIP. To tackle these limitations, we
propose OV-NeRF, which exploits the potential of pre-trained vision and

single-view and cross-view strategies. First, from the single-view perspective,
we introduce Region Semantic Ranking (RSR) regularization by leveraging 2D mask

work presents a fully distributed algorithm enabling a group of robots to

been introduced. One such widely-researched neural radiance field (NeRF) relies
on a neural network to represent 3D scenes, allowing for realistic view
synthesis from a small number of 2D images. However, most NeRF models are
constrained by long training and inference times. In comparison, Gaussian
Splatting (GS) is a novel, state-of-the-art technique for rendering points in a
3D scene by approximating their contribution to image pixels through Gaussian
distributions, warranting fast training and swift, real-time rendering. A
drawback of GS is the absence of a well-defined approach for its conditioning
due to the necessity to condition several hundred thousand Gaussian components.
To solve this, we introduce the Gaussian Mesh Splatting (GaMeS) model, which
allows modification of Gaussian components in a similar way as meshes. We
parameterize each Gaussian component by the vertices of the mesh face.
Furthermore, our model needs mesh initialization on input or estimated mesh
during training. We also define Gaussian splats solely based on their location
on the mesh, allowing for automatic adjustments in position, scale, and
rotation during animation. As a result, we obtain a real-time rendering of

novel views. However, their reliance on dense inputs and scene-specific
optimization has limited their broader applicability. Generalizable NeRFs
(Gen-NeRF), while intended to address this, often produce blurring artifacts in
unobserved regions with sparse inputs, which are full of uncertainty. In this
paper, we aim to diminish the uncertainty in Gen-NeRF for plausible renderings.
We assume that NeRF's inability to effectively mitigate this uncertainty stems
from its inherent lack of generative capacity. Therefore, we innovatively
propose an Indirect Diffusion-guided NeRF framework, termed ID-NeRF, to address
this uncertainty from a generative perspective by leveraging a distilled
diffusion prior as guidance. Specifically, to avoid model confusion caused by
directly regularizing with inconsistent samplings as in previous methods, our
approach introduces a strategy to indirectly inject the inherently missing
imagination into the learned implicit function through a diffusion-guided
latent space. Empirical evaluation across various benchmarks demonstrates the
superior performance of our approach in handling uncertainty with sparse

the fields of computer graphics and vision. While various methods have been
developed that integrate NeRFs or StyleGANs with instructional editing models

customization processes, and frequently result in reduced image quality. To
address the above problems, we propose the Efficient Monotonic Video Style
Avatar (Emo-Avatar) through deferred neural rendering that enhances StyleGAN's
capacity for producing dynamic, drivable portrait videos. We proposed a
two-stage deferred neural rendering pipeline. In the first stage, we utilize
few-shot PTI initialization to initialize the StyleGAN generator through
several extreme poses sampled from the video to capture the consistent

real-time and photo-realistic renderings. This technique typically takes
perspective images as input and optimizes a set of 3D elliptical Gaussians by
splatting them onto the image planes, resulting in 2D Gaussians. However,
applying 3D-GS to panoramic inputs presents challenges in effectively modeling
the projection onto the spherical surface of ${360^\circ}$ images using 2D
Gaussians. In practical applications, input panoramas are often sparse, leading
to unreliable initialization of 3D Gaussians and subsequent degradation of
3D-GS quality. In addition, due to the under-constrained geometry of
texture-less planes (e.g., walls and floors), 3D-GS struggles to model these
flat regions with elliptical Gaussians, resulting in significant floaters in
novel views. To address these issues, we propose 360-GS, a novel $360^{\circ}$
Gaussian splatting for a limited set of panoramic inputs. Instead of splatting
3D Gaussians directly onto the spherical surface, 360-GS projects them onto the
tangent plane of the unit sphere and then maps them to the spherical
projections. This adaptation enables the representation of the projection using
Gaussians. We guide the optimization of 360-GS by exploiting layout priors
within panoramas, which are simple to obtain and contain strong structural
information about the indoor scene. Our experimental results demonstrate that
360-GS allows panoramic rendering and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with

regularization, we leverage the depth information derived from NeRF to
establish image correspondences between different views. For learned
regularization, we align the latent codes in the 2D diffusion model between
edited and unedited images, enabling us to edit key views and propagate the
update throughout the entire scene. Incorporating these two strategies, our
ViCA-NeRF operates in two stages. In the initial stage, we blend edits from
different views to create a preliminary 3D edit. This is followed by a second

Notably, reducing Gaussian to 2D splats with a single view-space depth
introduces popping and blending artifacts during view rotation. Addressing this
issue requires accurate per-pixel depth computation, yet a full per-pixel sort
proves excessively costly compared to a global sort operation. In this paper,
we present a novel hierarchical rasterization approach that systematically
resorts and culls splats with minimal processing overhead. Our software
rasterizer effectively eliminates popping artifacts and view inconsistencies,
as demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative measurements.
Simultaneously, our method mitigates the potential for cheating view-dependent
effects with popping, ensuring a more authentic representation. Despite the
elimination of cheating, our approach achieves comparable quantitative results
for test images, while increasing the consistency for novel view synthesis in
motion. Due to its design, our hierarchical approach is only 4% slower on
average than the original Gaussian Splatting. Notably, enforcing consistency
enables a reduction in the number of Gaussians by approximately half with
nearly identical quality and view-consistency. Consequently, rendering

with image-based neural rendering for generalization, yielding impressive
results, while suffering from three issues. First, occlusions often result in
inconsistent feature matching. Then, they deliver distortions and artifacts in
geometric discontinuities and locally sharp shapes due to their individual
process of sampled points and rough feature aggregation. Third, their
image-based representations experience severe degradations when source views
are not near enough to the target view. To address challenges, we propose the
first paradigm that constructs the generalizable neural field based on
point-based rather than image-based rendering, which we call the Generalizable
neural Point Field (GPF). Our approach explicitly models visibilities by
geometric priors and augments them with neural features. We propose a novel
nonuniform log sampling strategy to improve both rendering speed and
reconstruction quality. Moreover, we present a learnable kernel spatially
augmented with features for feature aggregations, mitigating distortions at
places with drastically varying geometries. Besides, our representation can be
easily manipulated. Experiments show that our model can deliver better
geometries, view consistencies, and rendering quality than all counterparts and
benchmarks on three datasets in both generalization and finetuning settings,

hotspots in the fields of multidimensional signal processing and multimedia.
Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has recently been brought to this research field
in order to enhance the realism and 3D effect of the generated faces. However,
most existing NeRF-based methods either burden NeRF with complex learning tasks
while lacking methods for supervised multimodal feature fusion, or cannot
precisely map audio to the facial region related to speech movements. These
reasons ultimately result in existing methods generating inaccurate lip shapes.
This paper moves a portion of NeRF learning tasks ahead and proposes a talking
face synthesis method via NeRF with attention-based disentanglement (NeRF-AD).
In particular, an Attention-based Disentanglement module is introduced to
disentangle the face into Audio-face and Identity-face using speech-related
facial action unit (AU) information. To precisely regulate how audio affects
the talking face, we only fuse the Audio-face with audio feature. In addition,
AU information is also utilized to supervise the fusion of these two

been demonstrated to possess promising capability for geometry representation

head shape variations caused by changing poses and expressions. In this paper,
we introduce PSAvatar, a novel framework for animatable head avatar creation
that utilizes discrete geometric primitive to create a parametric morphable
shape model and employs 3D Gaussian for fine detail representation and high
fidelity rendering. The parametric morphable shape model is a Point-based
Morphable Shape Model (PMSM) which uses points instead of meshes for 3D
representation to achieve enhanced representation flexibility. The PMSM first
converts the FLAME mesh to points by sampling on the surfaces as well as off
the meshes to enable the reconstruction of not only surface-like structures but
also complex geometries such as eyeglasses and hairstyles. By aligning these
points with the head shape in an analysis-by-synthesis manner, the PMSM makes
it possible to utilize 3D Gaussian for fine detail representation and
appearance modeling, thus enabling the creation of high-fidelity avatars. We

method for compact 3D-consistent scene segmentation at fast rendering speed
with only RGB images input. Previous NeRF-based segmentation methods have
relied on time-consuming neural scene optimization. While recent 3D Gaussian
Splatting has notably improved speed, existing Gaussian-based segmentation
methods struggle to produce compact masks, especially in zero-shot
segmentation. This issue probably stems from their straightforward assignment
of learnable parameters to each Gaussian, resulting in a lack of robustness
against cross-view inconsistent 2D machine-generated labels. Our method aims to
address this problem by employing Dual Feature Fusion Network as Gaussians'
segmentation field. Specifically, we first optimize 3D Gaussians under RGB
supervision. After Gaussian Locating, DINO features extracted from images are
applied through explicit unprojection, which are further incorporated with
spatial features from the efficient point cloud processing network. Feature
aggregation is utilized to fuse them in a global-to-local strategy for compact
segmentation features. Experimental results show that our model outperforms

It supports dynamic motion and is tailored for shadow computation, thereby
avoiding the affine projection approximation and sorting required by the
closely related Gaussian splatting. Combined with a deferred neural rendering
model, our Gaussian shadows enable Lambertian shading and shadow casting with
minimal overhead. We demonstrate improved reconstructions, with better
separation of albedo, shading, and shadows in challenging outdoor scenes with
direct sun light and hard shadows. Our method is able to optimize the light

2401.00979v1;http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00979v1;2024-01-02;3D Visibility-aware Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields for Interacting  Hands;"Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are promising 3D representations for scenes,
objects, and humans. However, most existing methods require multi-view inputs
and per-scene training, which limits their real-life applications. Moreover,
current methods focus on single-subject cases, leaving scenes of interacting
hands that involve severe inter-hand occlusions and challenging view variations
remain unsolved. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a generalizable
visibility-aware NeRF (VA-NeRF) framework for interacting hands. Specifically,
given an image of interacting hands as input, our VA-NeRF first obtains a
mesh-based representation of hands and extracts their corresponding geometric
and textural features. Subsequently, a feature fusion module that exploits the
visibility of query points and mesh vertices is introduced to adaptively merge
features of both hands, enabling the recovery of features in unseen areas.
Additionally, our VA-NeRF is optimized together with a novel discriminator
within an adversarial learning paradigm. In contrast to conventional
discriminators that predict a single real/fake label for the synthesized image,
the proposed discriminator generates a pixel-wise visibility map, providing
fine-grained supervision for unseen areas and encouraging the VA-NeRF to
improve the visual quality of synthesized images. Experiments on the
Interhand2.6M dataset demonstrate that our proposed VA-NeRF outperforms
conventional NeRFs significantly. Project Page:

image per scene. Previous One-shot Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields

relies on the limited reference image. On the other hand, recent
diffusion-based image-to-3d methods show vivid plausible results via distilling
pre-trained 2D diffusion models into a 3D representation, yet require tedious
per-scene optimization. Targeting these issues, we propose the GD$^2$-NeRF, a
Generative Detail compensation framework via GAN and Diffusion that is both
inference-time finetuning-free and with vivid plausible details. In detail,
following a coarse-to-fine strategy, GD$^2$-NeRF is mainly composed of a
One-stage Parallel Pipeline (OPP) and a 3D-consistent Detail Enhancer
(Diff3DE). At the coarse stage, OPP first efficiently inserts the GAN model
into the existing OG-NeRF pipeline for primarily relieving the blurry issue
with in-distribution priors captured from the training dataset, achieving a
good balance between sharpness (LPIPS, FID) and fidelity (PSNR, SSIM). Then, at
the fine stage, Diff3DE further leverages the pre-trained image diffusion
models to complement rich out-distribution details while maintaining decent 3D
consistency. Extensive experiments on both the synthetic and real-world

synthesis with their photorealistic rendering quality. Nevertheless, they
usually employ neural networks and volumetric rendering, which are costly to
train and impede their broad use in various real-time applications due to the
lengthy rendering time. Lately 3D Gaussians splatting-based approach has been
proposed to model the 3D scene, and it achieves remarkable visual quality while
rendering the images in real-time. However, it suffers from severe degradation
in the rendering quality if the training images are blurry. Blurriness commonly
occurs due to the lens defocusing, object motion, and camera shake, and it
inevitably intervenes in clean image acquisition. Several previous studies have
attempted to render clean and sharp images from blurry input images using
neural fields. The majority of those works, however, are designed only for
volumetric rendering-based neural radiance fields and are not straightforwardly
applicable to rasterization-based 3D Gaussian splatting methods. Thus, we
propose a novel real-time deblurring framework, deblurring 3D Gaussian
Splatting, using a small Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that manipulates the
covariance of each 3D Gaussian to model the scene blurriness. While deblurring
3D Gaussian Splatting can still enjoy real-time rendering, it can reconstruct

rendering-based novel view synthesis. However, NeRF suffers from severe visual
quality degradation when the input images have been captured under imperfect

Especially, defocus blur is quite common in the images when they are normally
captured using cameras. Although few recent studies have proposed to render
sharp images of considerably high-quality, yet they still face many key
challenges. In particular, those methods have employed a Multi-Layer Perceptron

these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel technique Sharp-NeRF -- a
grid-based NeRF that renders clean and sharp images from the input blurry

sharpness level of the pixels is computed to learn the spatially varying blur
kernels. We have conducted experiments on the benchmarks consisting of blurry

LangSplat, which constructs a 3D language field that enables precise and
efficient open-vocabulary querying within 3D spaces. Unlike existing methods
that ground CLIP language embeddings in a NeRF model, LangSplat advances the
field by utilizing a collection of 3D Gaussians, each encoding language
features distilled from CLIP, to represent the language field. By employing a
tile-based splatting technique for rendering language features, we circumvent
the costly rendering process inherent in NeRF. Instead of directly learning
CLIP embeddings, LangSplat first trains a scene-wise language autoencoder and
then learns language features on the scene-specific latent space, thereby
alleviating substantial memory demands imposed by explicit modeling. Existing

variation of the material, which is often not a good representation of the

position, direction of observation, and direction of incidence. The latter is
considered a directional light incident across the entire non-self-shadowed

for camera localization in the same representation becomes manifestly apparent.
Doing so not only simplifies the localization process -- by avoiding an
outside-the-NeRF-based localization -- but also has the potential to offer the
benefit of enhanced localization. This paper studies the problem of localizing
cameras in NeRF using a diffusion model for camera pose adjustment. More
specifically, given a pre-trained NeRF model, we train a diffusion model that
iteratively updates randomly initialized camera poses, conditioned upon the
image to be localized. At test time, a new camera is localized in two steps:
first, coarse localization using the proposed pose diffusion process, followed
by local refinement steps of a pose inversion process in NeRF. In fact, the
proposed camera localization by pose diffusion (CaLDiff) method also integrates
the pose inversion steps within the diffusion process. Such integration offers
significantly better localization, thanks to our downstream refinement-aware
diffusion process. Our exhaustive experiments on challenging real-world data
validate our method by providing significantly better results than the compared
methods and the established baselines. Our source code will be made publicly

photo-realistic images in dynamic settings, which can be applied to scenarios
with human animation. Commonly used implicit backbones to establish accurate
models, however, require many input views and additional annotations such as
human masks, UV maps and depth maps. In this work, we propose ParDy-Human

digital avatar from as little as a single monocular sequence. ParDy-Human
introduces parameter-driven dynamics into 3D Gaussian Splatting where 3D
Gaussians are deformed by a human pose model to animate the avatar. Our method
is composed of two parts: A first module that deforms canonical 3D Gaussians
according to SMPL vertices and a consecutive module that further takes their
designed joint encodings and predicts per Gaussian deformations to deal with
dynamics beyond SMPL vertex deformations. Images are then synthesized by a
rasterizer. ParDy-Human constitutes an explicit model for realistic dynamic
human avatars which requires significantly fewer training views and images. Our
avatars learning is free of additional annotations such as masks and can be
trained with variable backgrounds while inferring full-resolution images

datasets using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Public datasets generally have
limited diversity in terms of human poses and camera viewpoints, largely due to
the resource-intensive nature of collecting 3D human pose data. As a result,
pose estimators trained on public datasets significantly underperform when
applied to unseen out-of-distribution samples. Previous works proposed
augmenting public datasets by generating 2D-3D pose pairs or rendering a large
amount of random data. Such approaches either overlook image rendering or
result in suboptimal datasets for pre-trained models. Here we propose PoseGen,
which learns to generate a dataset (human 3D poses and images) with a feedback
loss from a given pre-trained pose estimator. In contrast to prior art, our
generated data is optimized to improve the robustness of the pre-trained model.
The objective of PoseGen is to learn a distribution of data that maximizes the
prediction error of a given pre-trained model. As the learned data distribution
contains OOD samples of the pre-trained model, sampling data from such a
distribution for further fine-tuning a pre-trained model improves the
generalizability of the model. This is the first work that proposes NeRFs for
3D human data generation. NeRFs are data-driven and do not require 3D scans of
humans. Therefore, using NeRF for data generation is a new direction for
convenient user-specific data generation. Our extensive experiments show that
the proposed PoseGen improves two baseline models (SPIN and HybrIK) on four

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are a major topic driving current research and

particularly the density. Regarding this critical aspect, we propose to utilize
NeRF-Ensembles that provide a density uncertainty estimate alongside the mean
density. We demonstrate that data constraints such as low-quality images and
poses lead to a degradation of the training process, increased density
uncertainty and decreased predicted density. Even with high-quality input data,
the density uncertainty varies based on scene constraints such as acquisition
constellations, occlusions and material properties. NeRF-Ensembles not only
provide a tool for quantifying the uncertainty but exhibit two promising
advantages: Enhanced robustness and artifact removal. Through the utilization
of NeRF-Ensembles instead of single NeRFs, small outliers are removed, yielding
a smoother output with improved completeness of structures. Furthermore,
applying percentile-based thresholds on density uncertainty outliers proves to
be effective for the removal of large (foggy) artifacts in post-processing. We

from arbitrary viewpoints and times, offers immersive viewing experiences.
Neural radiance fields, particularly NeRF, initially developed for static
scenes, have spurred the creation of various methods for video view synthesis.
However, the challenge for video view synthesis arises from motion blur, a
consequence of object or camera movement during exposure, which hinders the
precise synthesis of sharp spatio-temporal views. In response, we propose a
novel dynamic deblurring NeRF framework for blurry monocular video, called
DyBluRF, consisting of an Interleave Ray Refinement (IRR) stage and a Motion
Decomposition-based Deblurring (MDD) stage. Our DyBluRF is the first that
addresses and handles the novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video. The
IRR stage jointly reconstructs dynamic 3D scenes and refines the inaccurate
camera pose information to combat imprecise pose information extracted from the
given blurry frames. The MDD stage is a novel incremental latent sharp-rays
prediction (ILSP) approach for the blurry monocular video frames by decomposing
the latent sharp rays into global camera motion and local object motion
components. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DyBluRF

leveraging the advantages of both NeRF and two-bounce light measured by lidar,
we demonstrate that we can reconstruct visible and occluded geometry without
data priors or reliance on controlled ambient lighting or scene albedo. In
addition, we demonstrate improved generalization under practical constraints on

diffusion models to generate multi-view images, followed by NeRF
reconstruction. Yet, existing supervised finetuned (SFT) diffusion models still
suffer from multi-view inconsistency and the resulting NeRF artifacts. Although
training longer with SFT improves consistency, it also causes distribution
shift, which reduces diversity and realistic details. We argue that the SFT of
multi-view diffusion models resembles the instruction finetuning stage of the
LLM alignment pipeline and can benefit from RL finetuning (RLFT) methods.
Essentially, RLFT methods optimize models beyond their SFT data distribution by
using their own outputs, effectively mitigating distribution shift. To this
end, we introduce Carve3D, a RLFT method coupled with the Multi-view
Reconstruction Consistency (MRC) metric, to improve the consistency of
multi-view diffusion models. To compute MRC on a set of multi-view images, we
compare them with their corresponding renderings of the reconstructed NeRF at
the same viewpoints. We validate the robustness of MRC with extensive
experiments conducted under controlled inconsistency levels. We enhance the
base RLFT algorithm to stabilize the training process, reduce distribution
shift, and identify scaling laws. Through qualitative and quantitative
experiments, along with a user study, we demonstrate Carve3D's improved

of producing evermore photo-realistic results. 3D Gaussian Splatting has
emerged as a particularly promising method, producing high-quality renderings

However, it is currently limited to static scenes only. In this work, we extend
3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct dynamic scenes. We model the dynamics of a
scene using a tunable MLP, which learns the deformation field from a canonical
space to a set of 3D Gaussians per frame. To disentangle the static and dynamic
parts of the scene, we learn a tuneable parameter for each Gaussian, which
weighs the respective MLP parameters to focus attention on the dynamic parts.
This improves the model's ability to capture dynamics in scenes with an
imbalance of static to dynamic regions. To handle scenes of arbitrary length
whilst maintaining high rendering quality, we introduce an adaptive window
sampling strategy to partition the sequence into windows based on the amount of
movement in the sequence. We train a separate dynamic Gaussian Splatting model
for each window, allowing the canonical representation to change, thus enabling
the reconstruction of scenes with significant geometric or topological changes.
Temporal consistency is enforced using a fine-tuning step with self-supervising

novel view images of a 3D scene. It includes density and color fields to model
the shape and radiance of a scene, respectively. Supervised by the photometric
loss in an end-to-end training manner, NeRF inherently suffers from the
shape-radiance ambiguity problem, i.e., it can perfectly fit training views but
does not guarantee decoupling the two fields correctly. To deal with this
issue, existing works have incorporated prior knowledge to provide an
independent supervision signal for the density field, including total variation
loss, sparsity loss, distortion loss, etc. These losses are based on general
assumptions about the density field, e.g., it should be smooth, sparse, or
compact, which are not adaptive to a specific scene. In this paper, we propose

rendering method that is only based on the density field. Specifically, we
first estimate the color field based on the density field and posed images in a
closed form. Then NeRF's rendering process can proceed. We address the problems

reconstruction from 2D images. However, reconstructing real-world captures of
complex scenes still remains a challenge. Existing generic 3D reconstruction
methods often struggle to represent fine geometric details and do not
adequately model reflective surfaces of large-scale scenes. Techniques that
explicitly focus on reflective surfaces can model complex and detailed
reflections by exploiting better reflection parameterizations. However, we
observe that these methods are often not robust in real unbounded scenarios
where non-reflective as well as reflective components are present. In this
work, we propose UniSDF, a general purpose 3D reconstruction method that can
reconstruct large complex scenes with reflections. We investigate both
view-based as well as reflection-based color prediction parameterization
techniques and find that explicitly blending these representations in 3D space
enables reconstruction of surfaces that are more geometrically accurate,
especially for reflective surfaces. We further combine this representation with
a multi-resolution grid backbone that is trained in a coarse-to-fine manner,
enabling faster reconstructions than prior methods. Extensive experiments on

Gaussians thus have the form of an image, the Splatter Image. We further extend
the method to incorporate more than one image as input, which we do by adding
cross-view attention. Owning to the speed of the renderer (588 FPS), we can use
a single GPU for training while generating entire images at each iteration in

This framework aims to guide the NeRF model to synthesize high-resolution novel

high-resolution training data. Our approach consists of two stages. First, we
learn a scene-specific degradation mapping by performing internal learning on a
pretrained low-resolution coarse NeRF. Second, we optimize a super-resolution
fine NeRF by conducting inverse rendering with our mapping function so as to
backpropagate the gradients from low-resolution 2D space into the

ensemble strategy in the inference phase to compensate for the scene estimation
errors. Our method is featured on two points: (1) it does not consume

for modeling of static 3D scenes. In contrast to Neural Radiance Fields, it
utilizes efficient rasterization allowing for very fast rendering at
high-quality. However, the storage size is significantly higher, which hinders
practical deployment, e.g.~on resource constrained devices. In this paper, we
introduce a compact scene representation organizing the parameters of 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into a 2D grid with local homogeneity, ensuring a
drastic reduction in storage requirements without compromising visual quality
during rendering. Central to our idea is the explicit exploitation of
perceptual redundancies present in natural scenes. In essence, the inherent
nature of a scene allows for numerous permutations of Gaussian parameters to
equivalently represent it. To this end, we propose a novel highly parallel
algorithm that regularly arranges the high-dimensional Gaussian parameters into
a 2D grid while preserving their neighborhood structure. During training, we
further enforce local smoothness between the sorted parameters in the grid. The
uncompressed Gaussians use the same structure as 3DGS, ensuring a seamless
integration with established renderers. Our method achieves a reduction factor
of 8x to 26x in size for complex scenes with no increase in training time,

scenario that prior robust reconstruction methods cannot deal with. Our
solution supports single-shot reconstruction by involving light-field networks,

from real-world images based on neural radiance fields. While the algorithm
imposes certain limitations on the scene representation and, thereby, the
supported scene types, it reliably detects and excludes inconsistent

solution is based on a fuzzy adaption of the random sample consensus paradigm,
enabling its application to large scale models. We interpret the minimal number

is applicable, as a cleaner set of samples improves reconstruction quality.
Further, this procedure also handles outliers. Especially for conditioned

the deformation field is sparse in spatial but dense in temporal due to the
continuity of of motion. Secondly, the radiance field is only valid on the

by the evolution of generative models. Prominent among these are methods based
on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and the adaptation of diffusion models in
the 3D domain. Despite their progress, these techniques often face limitations
due to slow optimization or rendering processes, leading to extensive training
and optimization times. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for
single-view reconstruction that efficiently generates a 3D model from a single

networks, namely a point decoder and a triplane decoder, to reconstruct 3D
objects using a hybrid Triplane-Gaussian intermediate representation. This
hybrid representation strikes a balance, achieving a faster rendering speed
compared to implicit representations while simultaneously delivering superior
rendering quality than explicit representations. The point decoder is designed
for generating point clouds from single images, offering an explicit
representation which is then utilized by the triplane decoder to query Gaussian
features for each point. This design choice addresses the challenges associated
with directly regressing explicit 3D Gaussian attributes characterized by their
non-structural nature. Subsequently, the 3D Gaussians are decoded by an MLP to
enable rapid rendering through splatting. Both decoders are built upon a
scalable, transformer-based architecture and have been efficiently trained on
large-scale 3D datasets. The evaluations conducted on both synthetic datasets

challenging task, because transparent object refracts light of background
causing visual distortions on the transparent object surface along the
viewpoint change. Recently introduced Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a view
synthesis method. Thanks to its remarkable performance improvement, lots of
following applications based on NeRF in various topics have been developed.
However, if an object with a different refractive index is included in a scene
such as transparent object, NeRF shows limited performance because refracted
light ray at the surface of the transparent object is not appropriately
considered. To resolve the problem, we propose a NeRF-based method consisting
of the following three steps: First, we reconstruct a three-dimensional shape
of a transparent object using visual hull. Second, we simulate the refraction
of the rays inside of the transparent object according to Snell's law. Last, we
sample points through refracted rays and put them into NeRF. Experimental

degradation compared to the vanilla NeRF. In contrast, we propose ProNeRF,

the common usage of 3DMM-based facial tracking has its limits; side-views can
hardly be captured and it fails, especially, for back-views, as required inputs
like facial landmarks or human parsing masks are missing. This results in
incomplete avatar reconstructions that only cover the frontal hemisphere. In
contrast to this, we propose a template-based tracking of the torso, head and
facial expressions which allows us to cover the appearance of a human subject
from all sides. Thus, given a sequence of a subject that is rotating in front
of a single camera, we train a neural volumetric representation based on neural
radiance fields. A key challenge to construct this representation is the
modeling of appearance changes, especially, in the mouth region (i.e., lips and
teeth). We, therefore, propose a deformation-field-based blend basis which

different ways, the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) method was used for
individual tree reconstruction and the exported point cloud models are compared
with point cloud derived from photogrammetric reconstruction and laser scanning
methods. The results show that the NeRF method performs well in individual tree
3D reconstruction, as it has higher successful reconstruction rate, better
reconstruction in the canopy area, it requires less amount of images as input.
Compared with photogrammetric reconstruction method, NeRF has significant
advantages in reconstruction efficiency and is adaptable to complex scenes, but
the generated point cloud tends to be noisy and low resolution. The accuracy of
tree structural parameters (tree height and diameter at breast height)
extracted from the photogrammetric point cloud is still higher than those of
derived from the NeRF point cloud. The results of this study illustrate the

Methods that use Neural Radiance fields are versatile for traditional tasks
such as novel view synthesis. In recent times, some work has emerged that aims
to extend the functionality of NeRF beyond view synthesis, for semantically
aware tasks such as editing and segmentation using 3D feature field
distillation from 2D foundation models. However, these methods have two major
limitations: (a) they are limited by the rendering speed of NeRF pipelines, and
(b) implicitly represented feature fields suffer from continuity artifacts
reducing feature quality. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has shown
state-of-the-art performance on real-time radiance field rendering. In this
work, we go one step further: in addition to radiance field rendering, we
enable 3D Gaussian splatting on arbitrary-dimension semantic features via 2D
foundation model distillation. This translation is not straightforward: naively
incorporating feature fields in the 3DGS framework leads to warp-level
divergence. We propose architectural and training changes to efficiently avert
this problem. Our proposed method is general, and our experiments showcase
novel view semantic segmentation, language-guided editing and segment anything
through learning feature fields from state-of-the-art 2D foundation models such
as SAM and CLIP-LSeg. Across experiments, our distillation method is able to
provide comparable or better results, while being significantly faster to both
train and render. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first
method to enable point and bounding-box prompting for radiance field
manipulation, by leveraging the SAM model. Project website at:

generative prior in a 3D multi-view reconstruction problem where we optimize a
NeRF using a combination of score distillation sampling and NeRF reconstruction
losses. Predicted depth is used as additional supervision to encourage accurate

scene represented by the neural radiance fields (NeRFs). Given an arbitrary
view and two sets of scene images captured at different timestamps, we can
predict the scene changes in that view, which has significant potential
applications in scene monitoring and measuring. We conducted preliminary
studies and found that such an exciting task cannot be easily achieved by
utilizing existing NeRFs and 2D change detection methods with many false or
missing detections. The main reason is that the 2D change detection is based on
the pixel appearance difference between spatial-aligned image pairs and
neglects the stereo information in the NeRF. To address the limitations, we
propose the C-NERF to represent scene changes as directional consistency
difference-based NeRF, which mainly contains three modules. We first perform
the spatial alignment of two NeRFs captured before and after changes. Then, we
identify the change points based on the direction-consistent constraint; that
is, real change points have similar change representations across view
directions, but fake change points do not. Finally, we design the change map
rendering process based on the built NeRFs and can generate the change map of
an arbitrarily specified view direction. To validate the effectiveness, we
build a new dataset containing ten scenes covering diverse scenarios with

robust technique to represent static scenes and enable high-quality and
real-time novel view synthesis. Building upon this technique, we propose a new
representation that explicitly decomposes the motion and appearance of dynamic
scenes into sparse control points and dense Gaussians, respectively. Our key
idea is to use sparse control points, significantly fewer in number than the
Gaussians, to learn compact 6 DoF transformation bases, which can be locally
interpolated through learned interpolation weights to yield the motion field of
3D Gaussians. We employ a deformation MLP to predict time-varying 6 DoF
transformations for each control point, which reduces learning complexities,
enhances learning abilities, and facilitates obtaining temporal and spatial
coherent motion patterns. Then, we jointly learn the 3D Gaussians, the
canonical space locations of control points, and the deformation MLP to
reconstruct the appearance, geometry, and dynamics of 3D scenes. During
learning, the location and number of control points are adaptively adjusted to
accommodate varying motion complexities in different regions, and an ARAP loss
following the principle of as rigid as possible is developed to enforce spatial
continuity and local rigidity of learned motions. Finally, thanks to the
explicit sparse motion representation and its decomposition from appearance,
our method can enable user-controlled motion editing while retaining
high-fidelity appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing approaches on novel view synthesis with a high rendering
speed and enables novel appearance-preserved motion editing applications.

synthesis but still lack a crucial component: precise measurement of
uncertainty in their predictions. Probabilistic NeRF methods have tried to
address this, but their output probabilities are not typically accurately
calibrated, and therefore do not capture the true confidence levels of the
model. Calibration is a particularly challenging problem in the sparse-view
setting, where additional held-out data is unavailable for fitting a calibrator
that generalizes to the test distribution. In this paper, we introduce the
first method for obtaining calibrated uncertainties from NeRF models. Our
method is based on a robust and efficient metric to calculate per-pixel
uncertainties from the predictive posterior distribution. We propose two
techniques that eliminate the need for held-out data. The first, based on patch
sampling, involves training two NeRF models for each scene. The second is a
novel meta-calibrator that only requires the training of one NeRF model. Our
proposed approach for obtaining calibrated uncertainties achieves

trajectories. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new reconstruction
framework based on neural radiance field (NeRF), named ColonNeRF, which
leverages neural rendering for novel view synthesis of long-sequence
colonoscopy. Specifically, to reconstruct the entire colon in a piecewise

effectively reducing shape dissimilarity and ensuring geometric consistency in
each segment. To learn both the simple and complex geometry in a unified

overcome the challenges from sparse views, we devise a DensiNet module for
densifying camera poses under the guidance of semantic consistency. We conduct

spherical harmonic (SH)-guided anisotropic features, parameterized by
multilayer perceptrons, facilitating ambiguity elimination while preserving the

address these challenges, we propose DynMF, a compact and efficient
representation that decomposes a dynamic scene into a few neural trajectories.
We argue that the per-point motions of a dynamic scene can be decomposed into a
small set of explicit or learned trajectories. Our carefully designed neural
framework consisting of a tiny set of learned basis queried only in time allows
for rendering speed similar to 3D Gaussian Splatting, surpassing 120 FPS, while
at the same time, requiring only double the storage compared to static scenes.
Our neural representation adequately constrains the inherently underconstrained
motion field of a dynamic scene leading to effective and fast optimization.
This is done by biding each point to motion coefficients that enforce the
per-point sharing of basis trajectories. By carefully applying a sparsity loss
to the motion coefficients, we are able to disentangle the motions that
comprise the scene, independently control them, and generate novel motion
combinations that have never been seen before. We can reach state-of-the-art

approach in this realm is Delta Denoising Score (DDS) - an image editing
technique based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) framework that leverages
the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models. However, relying
solely on the difference between scoring functions is insufficient for
preserving specific structural elements from the original image, a crucial
aspect of image editing. Inspired by the similarity and importance differences
between DDS and the contrastive learning for unpaired image-to-image

challenging task. Existing methods optimize 3D representations like mesh or
neural fields via score distillation sampling (SDS), which suffers from
inadequate fine details or excessive training time. In this paper, we propose
an efficient yet effective framework, HumanGaussian, that generates
high-quality 3D humans with fine-grained geometry and realistic appearance. Our
key insight is that 3D Gaussian Splatting is an efficient renderer with
periodic Gaussian shrinkage or growing, where such adaptive density control can
be naturally guided by intrinsic human structures. Specifically, 1) we first
propose a Structure-Aware SDS that simultaneously optimizes human appearance
and geometry. The multi-modal score function from both RGB and depth space is
leveraged to distill the Gaussian densification and pruning process. 2)
Moreover, we devise an Annealed Negative Prompt Guidance by decomposing SDS
into a noisier generative score and a cleaner classifier score, which well
addresses the over-saturation issue. The floating artifacts are further
eliminated based on Gaussian size in a prune-only phase to enhance generation
smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and
competitive quality of our framework, rendering vivid 3D humans under diverse
scenarios.

minimize change as well as provide good initialization for scene inpainting and
perform editing in real-time without per-editing training, all leads to
superior quality and performance. We test our method by performing editing on

reconstruction, providing a significant leap in rendering photorealistic
scenes. However, despite its efficacy, NeRF exhibits limited capability of
learning view-dependent effects compared to light field rendering or
image-based view synthesis. To that end, we introduce a modification to the
NeRF rendering equation which is as simple as a few lines of code change for
any NeRF variations, while greatly improving the rendering quality of
view-dependent effects. By swapping the integration operator and the direction
decoder network, we only integrate the positional features along the ray and
move the directional terms out of the integration, resulting in a
disentanglement of the view-dependent and independent components. The modified
equation is equivalent to the classical volumetric rendering in ideal cases on
object surfaces with Dirac densities. Furthermore, we prove that with the
errors caused by network approximation and numerical integration, our rendering
equation exhibits better convergence properties with lower error accumulations
compared to the classical NeRF. We also show that the modified equation can be
interpreted as light field rendering with learned ray embeddings. Experiments
on different NeRF variations show consistent improvements in the quality of
view-dependent effects with our simple modification.";Congyue Deng<author:sep>Jiawei Yang<author:sep>Leonidas Guibas<author:sep>Yue Wang;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16504v1;cs.CV;;nerf

reconstruction from multiple images using implicit neural representations,
exemplified by the neural radiance field (NeRF) method. Such methods, which are
based on volume rendering, can model various light phenomena, and various
extended methods have been proposed to accommodate different scenes and
situations. However, when handling scenes with multiple glass objects, e.g.,
objects in a glass showcase, modeling the target scene accurately has been
challenging due to the presence of multiple reflection and refraction effects.
Thus, this paper proposes a NeRF-based modeling method for scenes containing a
glass case. In the proposed method, refraction and reflection are modeled using
elements that are dependent and independent of the viewer's perspective. This
approach allows us to estimate the surfaces where refraction occurs, i.e.,
glass surfaces, and enables the separation and modeling of both direct and

and 3D asset creation from user-provided text prompts and images. However, the
challenging problem of text-to-4D dynamic 3D scene generation with diffusion
guidance remains largely unexplored. We propose Dream-in-4D, which features a
novel two-stage approach for text-to-4D synthesis, leveraging (1) 3D and 2D
diffusion guidance to effectively learn a high-quality static 3D asset in the
first stage; (2) a deformable neural radiance field that explicitly
disentangles the learned static asset from its deformation, preserving quality
during motion learning; and (3) a multi-resolution feature grid for the
deformation field with a displacement total variation loss to effectively learn
motion with video diffusion guidance in the second stage. Through a user
preference study, we demonstrate that our approach significantly advances image
and motion quality, 3D consistency and text fidelity for text-to-4D generation
compared to baseline approaches. Thanks to its motion-disentangled
representation, Dream-in-4D can also be easily adapted for controllable

intricate task of grasping objects that come in various shapes, materials, and
textures. Unlike many prior investigations that heavily leaned on specialized
point-cloud cameras or abundant RGB visual data to gather 3D insights for
object-grasping missions, this paper introduces a pioneering approach called
RGBGrasp. This method depends on a limited set of RGB views to perceive the 3D
surroundings containing transparent and specular objects and achieve accurate
grasping. Our method utilizes pre-trained depth prediction models to establish
geometry constraints, enabling precise 3D structure estimation, even under
limited view conditions. Finally, we integrate hash encoding and a proposal
sampler strategy to significantly accelerate the 3D reconstruction process.
These innovations significantly enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of
our algorithm in real-world scenarios. Through comprehensive experimental
validation, we demonstrate that RGBGrasp achieves remarkable success across a
wide spectrum of object-grasping scenarios, establishing it as a promising
solution for real-world robotic manipulation tasks. The demo of our method can

techniques have paved the way for the widespread adoption of 3D
representations. However, foundational approaches like 3D Gaussian Splatting
come with a substantial storage overhead caused by growing the SfM points to
millions, often demanding gigabyte-level disk space for a single unbounded
scene, posing significant scalability challenges and hindering the splatting
efficiency.
  To address this challenge, we introduce LightGaussian, a novel method
designed to transform 3D Gaussians into a more efficient and compact format.
Drawing inspiration from the concept of Network Pruning, LightGaussian
identifies Gaussians that are insignificant in contributing to the scene
reconstruction and adopts a pruning and recovery process, effectively reducing
redundancy in Gaussian counts while preserving visual effects. Additionally,
LightGaussian employs distillation and pseudo-view augmentation to distill
spherical harmonics to a lower degree, allowing knowledge transfer to more
compact representations while maintaining reflectance. Furthermore, we propose
a hybrid scheme, VecTree Quantization, to quantize all attributes, resulting in
lower bitwidth representations with minimal accuracy losses.
  In summary, LightGaussian achieves an averaged compression rate over 15x
while boosting the FPS from 139 to 215, enabling an efficient representation of
complex scenes on Mip-NeRF 360, Tank and Temple datasets.

2311.17089v1;http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17089v1;2023-11-28;Multi-Scale 3D Gaussian Splatting for Anti-Aliased Rendering;"3D Gaussians have recently emerged as a highly efficient representation for
3D reconstruction and rendering. Despite its high rendering quality and speed
at high resolutions, they both deteriorate drastically when rendered at lower
resolutions or from far away camera position. During low resolution or far away
rendering, the pixel size of the image can fall below the Nyquist frequency
compared to the screen size of each splatted 3D Gaussian and leads to aliasing
effect. The rendering is also drastically slowed down by the sequential alpha
blending of more splatted Gaussians per pixel. To address these issues, we
propose a multi-scale 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm, which maintains
Gaussians at different scales to represent the same scene. Higher-resolution
images are rendered with more small Gaussians, and lower-resolution images are
rendered with fewer larger Gaussians. With similar training time, our algorithm
can achieve 13\%-66\% PSNR and 160\%-2400\% rendering speed improvement at

scalable large-scale neural scene reconstruction. We structure the neural
representation as an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder processes
3D point coordinates to produce encoded features, and the decoder generates
geometric values that include volume densities of signed distances and colors.
Our approach first trains a coarse global model on the entire image dataset.
Subsequently, we partition the images into smaller blocks using KMeans with
each block being modeled by a dedicated local model. We enhance the overlapping
regions across different blocks by scaling up the bounding boxes of each local
block. Notably, the decoder from the global model is shared across distinct
blocks and therefore promoting alignment in the feature space of local
encoders. We propose an effective and efficient methodology to fuse the outputs

autonomous driving, as they greatly expand sensing capabilities. Despite the
fast development of Neural radiance field (NeRF) techniques and their wide

Existing methods for such scenes usually involve with spatial warping,

this paper presents a novel framework that learns a density space from the
scenes to guide the construction of a point-based renderer, dubbed as DGNR
(Density-Guided Neural Rendering). In DGNR, geometric priors are no longer
needed, which can be intrinsically learned from the density space through
volumetric rendering. Specifically, we make use of a differentiable renderer to
synthesize images from the neural density features obtained from the learned

Gaussians, a new avatar representation that leverages powerful 2D CNNs and 3D
Gaussian splatting to create high-fidelity avatars. To associate 3D Gaussians
with the animatable avatar, we learn a parametric template from the input
videos, and then parameterize the template on two front \& back canonical
Gaussian maps where each pixel represents a 3D Gaussian. The learned template
is adaptive to the wearing garments for modeling looser clothes like dresses.
Such template-guided 2D parameterization enables us to employ a powerful
StyleGAN-based CNN to learn the pose-dependent Gaussian maps for modeling
detailed dynamic appearances. Furthermore, we introduce a pose projection
strategy for better generalization given novel poses. Overall, our method can
create lifelike avatars with dynamic, realistic and generalized appearances.

capturing complex 3D scenes with high fidelity. However, one persistent
challenge that hinders the widespread adoption of NeRFs is the computational
bottleneck due to the volumetric rendering. On the other hand, 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an alternative representation that
leverages a 3D Gaussisan-based representation and adopts the rasterization
pipeline to render the images rather than volumetric rendering, achieving very
fast rendering speed and promising image quality. However, a significant
drawback arises as 3DGS entails a substantial number of 3D Gaussians to
maintain the high fidelity of the rendered images, which requires a large
amount of memory and storage. To address this critical issue, we place a
specific emphasis on two key objectives: reducing the number of Gaussian points
without sacrificing performance and compressing the Gaussian attributes, such
as view-dependent color and covariance. To this end, we propose a learnable
mask strategy that significantly reduces the number of Gaussians while
preserving high performance. In addition, we propose a compact but effective
representation of view-dependent color by employing a grid-based neural field
rather than relying on spherical harmonics. Finally, we learn codebooks to
compactly represent the geometric attributes of Gaussian by vector
quantization. In our extensive experiments, we consistently show over
10$\times$ reduced storage and enhanced rendering speed, while maintaining the
quality of the scene representation, compared to 3DGS. Our work provides a
comprehensive framework for 3D scene representation, achieving high

limited number of images while avoiding overfitting. Representing a 3D scene by
combining numerous Gaussian splats has yielded outstanding visual quality.
However, it tends to overfit the training views when only a small number of
images are available. To address this issue, we introduce a dense depth map as
a geometry guide to mitigate overfitting. We obtained the depth map using a
pre-trained monocular depth estimation model and aligning the scale and offset
using sparse COLMAP feature points. The adjusted depth aids in the color-based
optimization of 3D Gaussian splatting, mitigating floating artifacts, and
ensuring adherence to geometric constraints. We verify the proposed method on

3D Gaussian Splatting. Gaussian Splatting has recently become very popular as
it yields realistic rendering while being significantly faster to train than
NeRFs. It is however challenging to extract a mesh from the millions of tiny 3D
gaussians as these gaussians tend to be unorganized after optimization and no
method has been proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a regularization
term that encourages the gaussians to align well with the surface of the scene.
We then introduce a method that exploits this alignment to extract a mesh from
the Gaussians using Poisson reconstruction, which is fast, scalable, and
preserves details, in contrast to the Marching Cubes algorithm usually applied
to extract meshes from Neural SDFs. Finally, we introduce an optional
refinement strategy that binds gaussians to the surface of the mesh, and
jointly optimizes these Gaussians and the mesh through Gaussian splatting
rendering. This enables easy editing, sculpting, rigging, animating,
compositing and relighting of the Gaussians using traditional softwares by
manipulating the mesh instead of the gaussians themselves. Retrieving such an
editable mesh for realistic rendering is done within minutes with our method,

an efficient 3D Gaussian representation tailored for dynamic scenes in which we
define positions and rotations as functions of time while leaving other
time-invariant properties of the static 3D Gaussian unchanged. Notably, our
representation reduces memory usage, which is consistent regardless of the
input sequence length. Additionally, it mitigates the risk of overfitting
observed frames by accounting for temporal changes. The optimization of our
Gaussian representation based on image and flow reconstruction results in a

fast rendering, which also allows for high-quality novel view synthesis. The
key idea of Hyb-NeRF is to represent the scene using different encoding

memory-efficiency learnable positional features at coarse resolutions and the
fast optimization speed and local details of hash-based feature grids at fine

semantic prediction as an additional rendering task, \textit{i.e.}, the ""label

solve this problem, we propose Generalized Perception NeRF (GP-NeRF), a novel

To accomplish this goal, we introduce transformers to aggregate radiance as

Different from existing methods that consider cross-view and along-epipolar

paper are (i) Recovering accurate camera parameters via a robust pipeline from
unposed day-to-day images is equally crucial in neural novel view synthesis
problem; (ii) It is rather more practical to model object's content at
different resolutions since dramatic camera motion is highly likely in

assuming per view depth prediction is given up to scale, we constrain the
relative pose between successive frames. From the relative poses, absolute
camera pose estimation is modeled via a graph-neural network-based multiple
motion averaging within the multi-scale neural-fields network, leading to a
single loss function. Optimizing the introduced loss function provides camera
intrinsic, extrinsic, and image rendering from unposed images. We demonstrate,

it is equally essential to have precise camera-pose estimates within the scene

correct certain visual artifacts, while rendering over three times faster. Our
work is orthogonal to other techniques for improving NeRF efficiency. Further,
we can control the tradeoff between efficiency and image quality by shrinking
the AE architecture, achieving over 13 times faster rendering with only a small

consistent recognition and granularity of objects from different viewpoints,

synthesis given multi-view images. Recently, some works have attempted to train
a NeRF from a single image with 3D priors. They mainly focus on a limited field
of view with a few occlusions, which greatly limits their scalability to
real-world 360-degree panoramic scenarios with large-size occlusions. In this
paper, we present PERF, a 360-degree novel view synthesis framework that trains
a panoramic neural radiance field from a single panorama. Notably, PERF allows
3D roaming in a complex scene without expensive and tedious image collection.
To achieve this goal, we propose a novel collaborative RGBD inpainting method
and a progressive inpainting-and-erasing method to lift up a 360-degree 2D
scene to a 3D scene. Specifically, we first predict a panoramic depth map as
initialization given a single panorama and reconstruct visible 3D regions with
volume rendering. Then we introduce a collaborative RGBD inpainting approach
into a NeRF for completing RGB images and depth maps from random views, which
is derived from an RGB Stable Diffusion model and a monocular depth estimator.
Finally, we introduce an inpainting-and-erasing strategy to avoid inconsistent
geometry between a newly-sampled view and reference views. The two components
are integrated into the learning of NeRFs in a unified optimization framework

Thus, the assumption can harm training. To avoid this harmful training, we

heterogeneity in different directions, we use a pre-trained transformer model

a nutshell, our framework optimizes camera poses in a coarse-to-fine manner and

Unlike coordinate-based neural radiance fields in need of sufficient views of
one scene, our model is applicable to single or few inputs and performs well on
images from unseen scenes. To enable generalization across scenes, we propose
to use reprojection supervision to induce the predicted MPI to learn the
correct geometry between the 3D coordinates and the images. Moreover, we remove

learning the 3D structure. Given an RGB image and its corresponding RPC, the
end-to-end model learns to synthesize the novel view with a new RPC and

methods, which allow the manipulation of existing 3D objects through textual
conditioning. However, existing NeRF editing techniques have faced limitations
in their performance due to slow training speeds and the use of loss functions
that do not adequately consider editing. To address this, here we present a
novel 3D NeRF editing approach dubbed ED-NeRF by successfully embedding
real-world scenes into the latent space of the latent diffusion model (LDM)

backbone that is not only faster but also more amenable to editing compared to
traditional image space NeRF editing. Furthermore, we propose an improved loss
function tailored for editing by migrating the delta denoising score (DDS)
distillation loss, originally used in 2D image editing to the three-dimensional

notable ambiguity. We also propose a self-supervised learning method that
regularizes the MIMO MLP with multiple fast reformulated MLPs to alleviate this

on multi-plane images (MPI), for high-quality view synthesis of complex scenes.
MPI with Normalized Device Coordinate (NDC) parameterization is widely used in
NeRF learning for its simple definition, easy calculation, and powerful ability
to represent unbounded scenes. However, existing NeRF works that adopt MPI
representation for novel view synthesis can only handle simple forward-facing
unbounded scenes, where the input cameras are all observing in similar
directions with small relative translations. Hence, extending these MPI-based
methods to more complex scenes like large-range or even 360-degree scenes is
very challenging. In this paper, we explore the potential of MPI and show that
MPI can synthesize high-quality novel views of complex scenes with diverse
camera distributions and view directions, which are not only limited to simple
forward-facing scenes. Our key idea is to encode the neural radiance field with
multiple MPIs facing different directions and blend them with an adaptive
blending operation. For each region of the scene, the blending operation gives
larger blending weights to those advantaged MPIs with stronger local
representation abilities while giving lower weights to those with weaker
representation abilities. Such blending operation automatically modulates the
multiple MPIs to appropriately represent the diverse local density and color
information. Experiments on the KITTI dataset and ScanNet dataset demonstrate
that our proposed MMPI synthesizes high-quality images from diverse camera pose
distributions and is fast to train, outperforming the previous fast-training

non-smooth and discontinuous, which is difficult to be fitted by commonly used
smooth motion models. To address this problem, we propose to estimate the
forward flow field and directly warp the canonical radiance field to other time
steps. Such forward flow field is smooth and continuous within the object
region, which benefits the motion model learning. To achieve this goal, we
represent the canonical radiance field with voxel grids to enable efficient
forward warping, and propose a differentiable warping process, including an

challenging problem of predicting the view from that pose based on a set of
reference RGBD views. Existing explicit or implicit 3D geometry construction
methods are computationally expensive while those based on learning have
predominantly focused on isolated views of object categories with regular
geometric structure. Differing from the traditional \textit{render-inpaint}
approach to new view synthesis in the real indoor environment, we propose a
conditional generative adversarial neural network (P2I-NET) to directly predict
the new view from the given pose. P2I-NET learns the conditional distribution
of the images of the environment for establishing the correspondence between
the camera pose and its view of the environment, and achieves this through a
number of innovative designs in its architecture and training lost function.
Two auxiliary discriminator constraints are introduced for enforcing the
consistency between the pose of the generated image and that of the
corresponding real world image in both the latent feature space and the real
world pose space. Additionally a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is
introduced to further reinforce this consistency in the pixel space. We have
performed extensive new view synthesis experiments on real indoor datasets.
Results show that P2I-NET has superior performance against a number of NeRF

NeRF network configuration and hyperparameter. As a result, the direct usage of
density values, e.g. via filtering with global density thresholds, usually
requires empirical investigations. Under the assumption that the density
increases from non-object to object area, the utilization of density gradients
from relative values is evident. As the density represents a position-dependent
parameter it can be handled anisotropically, therefore processing of the
voxelized 3D density field is justified. In this regard, we address geometric
3D reconstructions based on density gradients, whereas the gradients result
from 3D edge detection filters of the first and second derivatives, namely
Sobel, Canny and Laplacian of Gaussian. The gradients rely on relative
neighboring density values in all directions, thus are independent from
absolute magnitudes. Consequently, gradient filters are able to extract edges
along a wide density range, almost independent from assumptions and empirical
investigations. Our approach demonstrates the capability to achieve geometric

multi-step optimization techniques for parametric pre-fitting of the 3D body
models that suffer from misalignment with the images in sparse view settings
causing hallucinations in synthesized views. In this work, we propose,
GenLayNeRF, a generalizable layered scene representation for free-viewpoint
rendering of multiple human subjects which requires no per-scene optimization
and very sparse views as input. We divide the scene into multi-human layers
anchored by the 3D body meshes. We then ensure pixel-level alignment of the
body models with the input views through a novel end-to-end trainable module
that carries out iterative parametric correction coupled with multi-view
feature fusion to produce aligned 3D models. For NVS, we extract point-wise
image-aligned and human-anchored features which are correlated and fused using
self-attention and cross-attention modules. We augment low-level RGB values
into the features with an attention-based RGB fusion module. To evaluate our
approach, we construct two multi-human view synthesis datasets; DeepMultiSyn

reconstruct and reanimate dynamic portrait scenes with control over head-pose,
facial expressions and viewing direction. However, training such models assumes
photometric consistency over the deformed region e.g. the face must be evenly
lit as it deforms with changing head-pose and facial expression. Such
photometric consistency across frames of a video is hard to maintain, even in
studio environments, thus making the created reanimatable neural portraits
prone to artifacts during reanimation. In this work, we propose CoDyNeRF, a
system that enables the creation of fully controllable 3D portraits in
real-world capture conditions. CoDyNeRF learns to approximate illumination
dependent effects via a dynamic appearance model in the canonical space that is
conditioned on predicted surface normals and the facial expressions and
head-pose deformations. The surface normals prediction is guided using 3DMM
normals that act as a coarse prior for the normals of the human head, where
direct prediction of normals is hard due to rigid and non-rigid deformations
induced by head-pose and facial expression changes. Using only a
smartphone-captured short video of a subject for training, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on free view synthesis of a portrait scene with
explicit head pose and expression controls, and realistic lighting effects. The

high-fidelity images. However, current diffusion-based methods directly rely on

Building on this insight, we generate avatars with a compositional model, in

notably in sports broadcasting. Photorealistic novel view synthesis of soccer
actions, in particular, is of enormous interest to the broadcast industry. Yet
only a few industrial solutions have been proposed, and even fewer that achieve
near-broadcast quality of the synthetic replays. Except for their setup of
multiple static cameras around the playfield, the best proprietary systems
disclose close to no information about their inner workings. Leveraging
multiple static cameras for such a task indeed presents a challenge rarely
tackled in the literature, for a lack of public datasets: the reconstruction of
a large-scale, mostly static environment, with small, fast-moving elements.
Recently, the emergence of neural radiance fields has induced stunning progress
in many novel view synthesis applications, leveraging deep learning principles
to produce photorealistic results in the most challenging settings. In this
work, we investigate the feasibility of basing a solution to the task on
dynamic NeRFs, i.e., neural models purposed to reconstruct general dynamic
content. We compose synthetic soccer environments and conduct multiple
experiments using them, identifying key components that help reconstruct soccer
scenes with dynamic NeRFs. We show that, although this approach cannot fully
meet the quality requirements for the target application, it suggests promising
avenues toward a cost-efficient, automatic solution. We also make our work

human avatars. Towards this end, both explicit and implicit 3D representations
are heavily studied for a holistic modeling and capture of the whole human
(e.g., body, clothing, face and hair), but neither representation is an optimal
choice in terms of representation efficacy since different parts of the human
avatar have different modeling desiderata. For example, meshes are generally
not suitable for modeling clothing and hair. Motivated by this, we present
Disentangled Avatars~(DELTA), which models humans with hybrid explicit-implicit
3D representations. DELTA takes a monocular RGB video as input, and produces a
human avatar with separate body and clothing/hair layers. Specifically, we
demonstrate two important applications for DELTA. For the first one, we
consider the disentanglement of the human body and clothing and in the second,
we disentangle the face and hair. To do so, DELTA represents the body or face
with an explicit mesh-based parametric 3D model and the clothing or hair with
an implicit neural radiance field. To make this possible, we design an
end-to-end differentiable renderer that integrates meshes into volumetric
rendering, enabling DELTA to learn directly from monocular videos without any
3D supervision. Finally, we show that how these two applications can be easily
combined to model full-body avatars, such that the hair, face, body and
clothing can be fully disentangled yet jointly rendered. Such a disentanglement
enables hair and clothing transfer to arbitrary body shapes. We empirically
validate the effectiveness of DELTA's disentanglement by demonstrating its
promising performance on disentangled reconstruction, virtual clothing try-on
and hairstyle transfer. To facilitate future research, we also release an
open-sourced pipeline for the study of hybrid human avatar modeling.";Yao Feng<author:sep>Weiyang Liu<author:sep>Timo Bolkart<author:sep>Jinlong Yang<author:sep>Marc Pollefeys<author:sep>Michael J.

editing. However, editing 3D scenes is still in its early stages. It poses
various challenges, such as the requirement to design specific methods for
different editing types, retraining new models for various 3D scenes, and the
absence of convenient human interaction during editing. To tackle these issues,
we introduce a text-driven editing method, termed DN2N, which allows for the
direct acquisition of a NeRF model with universal editing capabilities,
eliminating the requirement for retraining. Our method employs off-the-shelf
text-based editing models of 2D images to modify the 3D scene images, followed
by a filtering process to discard poorly edited images that disrupt 3D
consistency. We then consider the remaining inconsistency as a problem of
removing noise perturbation, which can be solved by generating training data
with similar perturbation characteristics for training. We further propose
cross-view regularization terms to help the generalized NeRF model mitigate
these perturbations. Our text-driven method allows users to edit a 3D scene
with their desired description, which is more friendly, intuitive, and
practical than prior works. Empirical results show that our method achieves
multiple editing types, including but not limited to appearance editing,
weather transition, material changing, and style transfer. Most importantly,
our method generalizes well with editing abilities shared among a set of model
parameters without requiring a customized editing model for some specific
scenes, thus inferring novel views with editing effects directly from user

view synthesis task has been widely explored. However, existing methods are
limited to objects and indoor scenes. In this work, we extend the
generalization task to outdoor scenes, trained only on object-level datasets.
This approach presents two challenges. Firstly, the significant distributional
shift between training and testing scenes leads to black artifacts in rendering
results. Secondly, viewpoint changes in outdoor scenes cause ghosting or
missing regions in rendered images. To address these challenges, we propose a
geometric correction module and an appearance correction module based on
multi-head attention mechanisms. We normalize rendered depth and combine it
with light direction as query in the attention mechanism. Our network
effectively corrects varying scene structures and geometric features in outdoor
scenes, generalizing well from object-level to unseen outdoor scenes.
Additionally, we use appearance correction module to correct appearance
features, preventing rendering artifacts like blank borders and ghosting due to
viewpoint changes. By combining these modules, our approach successfully
tackles the challenges of outdoor scene generalization, producing high-quality
rendering results. When evaluated on four datasets (Blender, DTU, LLFF,

involves transferring the style of an artistic domain onto a target 3D face
with stylized geometry and texture. Although fine-tuning a pre-trained 3D GAN
on the artistic domain can produce reasonable performance, this strategy has
limitations in the 3D domain. In particular, fine-tuning can deteriorate the
original GAN latent space, which affects subsequent semantic editing, and
requires independent optimization and storage for each new style, limiting
flexibility and efficient deployment. To overcome these challenges, we propose
DeformToon3D, an effective toonification framework tailored for hierarchical 3D
GAN. Our approach decomposes 3D toonification into subproblems of geometry and
texture stylization to better preserve the original latent space. Specifically,
we devise a novel StyleField that predicts conditional 3D deformation to align
a real-space NeRF to the style space for geometry stylization. Thanks to the
StyleField formulation, which already handles geometry stylization well,
texture stylization can be achieved conveniently via adaptive style mixing that
injects information of the artistic domain into the decoder of the pre-trained

sampling of images in the given scene, and their performance degrades
significantly when only a sparse set of views are available. Researchers have
found that supervising the depth estimated by the NeRF helps train it
effectively with fewer views. The depth supervision is obtained either using
classical approaches or neural networks pre-trained on a large dataset. While
the former may provide only sparse supervision, the latter may suffer from
generalization issues. As opposed to the earlier approaches, we seek to learn
the depth supervision by designing augmented models and training them along

exploring the role of positional encoding and view-dependent radiance in
training the few-shot NeRF. The depth estimated by these simpler models is used
to supervise the NeRF depth estimates. Since the augmented models can be
inaccurate in certain regions, we design a mechanism to choose only reliable

creating realistic 3D scenes. However, its applicability to extensive scenes
remains challenging, with limitations in effectiveness. In this work, we
propose the Drone-NeRF framework to enhance the efficient reconstruction of
unbounded large-scale scenes suited for drone oblique photography using Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF). Our approach involves dividing the scene into uniform
sub-blocks based on camera position and depth visibility. Sub-scenes are
trained in parallel using NeRF, then merged for a complete scene. We refine the
model by optimizing camera poses and guiding NeRF with a uniform sampler.
Integrating chosen samples enhances accuracy. A hash-coded fusion MLP
accelerates density representation, yielding RGB and Depth outputs. Our
framework accounts for sub-scene constraints, reduces parallel-training noise,
handles shadow occlusion, and merges sub-regions for a polished rendering

value, as the ray sampling strategy profoundly impacts network convergence.
More efficient ray sampling can thus directly enhance existing NeRF models'
training efficiency. We therefore propose a novel ray sampling approach for
neural radiance fields that improves training efficiency while retaining
photorealistic rendering results. First, we analyze the relationship between
the pixel loss distribution of sampled rays and rendering quality. This reveals
redundancy in the original NeRF's uniform ray sampling. Guided by this finding,
we develop a sampling method leveraging pixel regions and depth boundaries. Our
main idea is to sample fewer rays in training views, yet with each ray more
informative for scene fitting. Sampling probability increases in pixel areas
exhibiting significant color and depth variation, greatly reducing wasteful
rays from other regions without sacrificing precision. Through this method, not
only can the convergence of the network be accelerated, but the spatial
geometry of a scene can also be perceived more accurately. Rendering outputs
are enhanced, especially for texture-complex regions. Experiments demonstrate

multi-view images and it has achieved very impressive success in recent years.
Most existing works share the pipeline of training a coarse pose estimator with
rendered images at first, followed by a joint optimization of estimated poses
and neural radiance field. However, as the pose estimator is trained with only
rendered images, the pose estimation is usually biased or inaccurate for real
images due to the domain gap between real images and rendered images, leading
to poor robustness for the pose estimation of real images and further local
minima in joint optimization. We design IR-NeRF, an innovative pose-free NeRF
that introduces implicit pose regularization to refine pose estimator with
unposed real images and improve the robustness of the pose estimation for real
images. With a collection of 2D images of a specific scene, IR-NeRF constructs
a scene codebook that stores scene features and captures the scene-specific
pose distribution implicitly as priors. Thus, the robustness of pose estimation
can be promoted with the scene priors according to the rationale that a 2D real
image can be well reconstructed from the scene codebook only when its estimated
pose lies within the pose distribution. Extensive experiments show that IR-NeRF

Efficiently incorporating such continuous change is an open challenge. Standard

advances in high-quality view synthesis. A major limitation of NeRF is its low
rendering efficiency due to the need for multiple network forwardings to render

required samples or optimize the implementation to accelerate the network
forwarding. Despite these efforts, the problem of multiple sampling persists
due to the intrinsic representation of radiance fields. In contrast, Neural
Light Fields (NeLF) reduce the computation cost of NeRF by querying only one
single network forwarding per pixel. To achieve a close visual quality to NeRF,
existing NeLF methods require significantly larger network capacities which
limits their rendering efficiency in practice. In this work, we propose a new

efficient view synthesis in real-time. Specifically, we use a small network
similar to NeRF while preserving the rendering speed with a single network
forwarding per pixel as in NeLF. The key is to model the radiance distribution
along each ray with frequency basis and predict frequency weights using the

analyze how different camera parameterizations affect this joint optimization
problem, and observe that standard parameterizations exhibit large differences
in magnitude with respect to small perturbations, which can lead to an
ill-conditioned optimization problem. We propose using a proxy problem to
compute a whitening transform that eliminates the correlation between camera

representation of a scene and generate photo-realistic novel views with high
fidelity. However, most proposed settings concentrate on modelling a single

a scene at multiple levels, resulting in a layered capture. For example,
tourists usually capture a monument's exterior structure before capturing the
inner structure. Modelling such scenes in 3D with seamless switching between
levels can drastically improve immersive experiences. However, most existing
techniques struggle in modelling such scenes. We propose Strata-NeRF, a single
neural radiance field that implicitly captures a scene with multiple levels.
Strata-NeRF achieves this by conditioning the NeRFs on Vector Quantized (VQ)
latent representations which allow sudden changes in scene structure. We
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in multi-layered synthetic dataset

However, previous works mostly focus on achieving photorealistic details,
neglecting the exploration of human parsing. Additionally, classical semantic
work are all limited in their ability to efficiently represent fine results in
complex motions. Human parsing is inherently related to radiance
reconstruction, as similar appearance and geometry often correspond to similar
semantic part. Furthermore, previous works often design a motion field that
maps from the observation space to the canonical space, while it tends to
exhibit either underfitting or overfitting, resulting in limited
generalization. In this paper, we present Semantic-Human, a novel method that
achieves both photorealistic details and viewpoint-consistent human parsing for
the neural rendering of humans. Specifically, we extend neural radiance fields
(NeRF) to jointly encode semantics, appearance and geometry to achieve accurate
2D semantic labels using noisy pseudo-label supervision. Leveraging the
inherent consistency and smoothness properties of NeRF, Semantic-Human achieves
consistent human parsing in both continuous and novel views. We also introduce

  To address this issue, we propose HollowNeRF, a novel compression solution

trains a coarse 3D saliency mask that guides efficient feature pruning, and
employs an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) pruner to
sparsify the 3D saliency mask during training. By exploiting the sparsity in
the 3D scene to redistribute hash collisions, HollowNeRF improves rendering

in synthesizing novel views with a limited number of observed viewpoints.
However, due to the inherent limitations of sparse inputs and the gap between
non-adjacent views, rendering results often suffer from over-fitting and foggy
surfaces, a phenomenon we refer to as ""CONFUSION"" during volume rendering. In
this paper, we analyze the root cause of this confusion and attribute it to two
fundamental questions: ""WHERE"" and ""HOW"". To this end, we present a novel
learning framework, WaH-NeRF, which effectively mitigates confusion by tackling
the following challenges: (i)""WHERE"" to Sample? in NeRF-S -- we introduce a
Deformable Sampling strategy and a Weight-based Mutual Information Loss to
address sample-position confusion arising from the limited number of
viewpoints; and (ii) ""HOW"" to Predict? in NeRF-S -- we propose a
Semi-Supervised NeRF learning Paradigm based on pose perturbation and a
Pixel-Patch Correspondence Loss to alleviate prediction confusion caused by the
disparity between training and testing viewpoints. By integrating our proposed

real-world 3D scenes, offering superior performance in novel view synthesis. In
this paper, we target a more challenging scenario, i.e., joint scene novel view
synthesis and editing based on implicit neural scene representations.
State-of-the-art methods in this direction typically consider building separate
networks for these two tasks (i.e., view synthesis and editing). Thus, the
modeling of interactions and correlations between these two tasks is very
limited, which, however, is critical for learning high-quality scene
representations. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a unified
Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) framework to effectively perform joint scene
decomposition and composition for modeling real-world scenes. The decomposition
aims at learning disentangled 3D representations of different objects and the
background, allowing for scene editing, while scene composition models an
entire scene representation for novel view synthesis. Specifically, with a
two-stage NeRF framework, we learn a coarse stage for predicting a global
radiance field as guidance for point sampling, and in the second fine-grained
stage, we perform scene decomposition by a novel one-hot object radiance field
regularization module and a pseudo supervision via inpainting to handle
ambiguous background regions occluded by objects. The decomposed object-level
radiance fields are further composed by using activations from the
decomposition module. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results show the

reach a target in 3D space. Expanding on recent advances in the differentiable
rendering of optically reflective materials, we introduce new methods for pose
estimation of radiolucent objects using X-ray projections, and we demonstrate
the critical role of optimal view synthesis in performing this task. We first
develop an algorithm (DiffDRR) that efficiently computes Digitally
Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) and leverages automatic differentiation within
TensorFlow. Pose estimation is performed by iterative gradient descent using a
loss function that quantifies the similarity of the DRR synthesized from a
randomly initialized pose and the true fluoroscopic image at the target pose.
We propose two novel methods for high-fidelity view synthesis, Neural Tuned
Tomography (NeTT) and masked Neural Radiance Fields (mNeRF). Both methods rely
on classic Cone-Beam Computerized Tomography (CBCT); NeTT directly optimizes
the CBCT densities, while the non-zero values of mNeRF are constrained by a 3D
mask of the anatomic region segmented from CBCT. We demonstrate that both NeTT
and mNeRF distinctly improve pose estimation within our framework. By defining
a successful pose estimate to be a 3D angle error of less than 3 deg, we find
that NeTT and mNeRF can achieve similar results, both with overall success
rates more than 93%. However, the computational cost of NeTT is significantly
lower than mNeRF in both training and pose estimation. Furthermore, we show
that a NeTT trained for a single subject can generalize to synthesize

DOT introduces the sampling and pruning operations for octrees to aggregate

these issues, we present a brand-new framework named TransHuman, which learns
the painted SMPL under the canonical space and captures the global
relationships between human parts with transformers. Specifically, TransHuman
is mainly composed of Transformer-based Human Encoding (TransHE), Deformable
Partial Radiance Fields (DPaRF), and Fine-grained Detail Integration (FDI).
TransHE first processes the painted SMPL under the canonical space via
transformers for capturing the global relationships between human parts. Then,
DPaRF binds each output token with a deformable radiance field for encoding the
query point under the observation space. Finally, the FDI is employed to
further integrate fine-grained information from reference images. Extensive
experiments on ZJU-MoCap and H36M show that our TransHuman achieves a
significantly new state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency. Project

deformation using the latent code. However, representing a scene deformation
with a single latent code is unfavorable for compositing local deformations
observed in different instances. As so, our proposed Position-conditional

optimized to yield high cosine similarity to a target text in CLIP embedding

years. However, most current methods still require intensive resources due to
ray marching-based rendering. To construct urban-level radiance fields
efficiently, we design Deformable Neural Mesh Primitive~(DNMP), and propose to
parameterize the entire scene with such primitives. The DNMP is a flexible and
compact neural variant of classic mesh representation, which enjoys both the
efficiency of rasterization-based rendering and the powerful neural
representation capability for photo-realistic image synthesis. Specifically, a
DNMP consists of a set of connected deformable mesh vertices with paired vertex
features to parameterize the geometry and radiance information of a local area.
To constrain the degree of freedom for optimization and lower the storage
budgets, we enforce the shape of each primitive to be decoded from a relatively
low-dimensional latent space. The rendering colors are decoded from the vertex
features (interpolated with rasterization) by a view-dependent MLP. The DNMP
provides a new paradigm for urban-level scene representation with appealing

performance for novel view synthesis in urban scenarios. $(2)$ Low
computational costs. Our representation enables fast rendering (2.07ms/1k

scenes by sampling a single ray per pixel and it has demonstrated impressive
capabilities in novel-view synthesis from static scene images. However, in
practice, we usually need to recover NeRF from unconstrained image collections,
which poses two challenges: 1) the images often have dynamic changes in
appearance because of different capturing time and camera settings; 2) the
images may contain transient objects such as humans and cars, leading to
occlusion and ghosting artifacts. Conventional approaches seek to address these
challenges by locally utilizing a single ray to synthesize a color of a pixel.
In contrast, humans typically perceive appearance and objects by globally
utilizing information across multiple pixels. To mimic the perception process
of humans, in this paper, we propose Cross-Ray NeRF (CR-NeRF) that leverages
interactive information across multiple rays to synthesize occlusion-free novel
views with the same appearances as the images. Specifically, to model varying
appearances, we first propose to represent multiple rays with a novel cross-ray
feature and then recover the appearance by fusing global statistics, i.e.,
feature covariance of the rays and the image appearance. Moreover, to avoid
occlusion introduced by transient objects, we propose a transient objects

successfully applied to various geospatial prediction and generative tasks.
However, all current 2D and 3D location encoders are designed to model point
distances in Euclidean space. So when applied to large-scale real-world GPS
coordinate datasets, which require distance metric learning on the spherical
surface, both types of models can fail due to the map projection distortion
problem (2D) and the spherical-to-Euclidean distance approximation error (3D).
To solve these problems, we propose a multi-scale location encoder called
Sphere2Vec which can preserve spherical distances when encoding point
coordinates on a spherical surface. We developed a unified view of
distance-reserving encoding on spheres based on the DFS. We also provide
theoretical proof that the Sphere2Vec preserves the spherical surface distance
between any two points, while existing encoding schemes do not. Experiments on

on all these datasets with up to 30.8% error rate reduction. We then apply
Sphere2Vec to three geo-aware image classification tasks - fine-grained species

Results on 7 real-world datasets show the superiority of Sphere2Vec over
multiple location encoders on all three tasks. Further analysis shows that

NeAT, and NeRP) have started showing unique capabilities in medical imaging. In
this work, we present a novel Polychromatic neural representation (Polyner) to
tackle the challenging problem of CT imaging when metallic implants exist
within the human body. CT metal artifacts arise from the drastic variation of
metal's attenuation coefficients at various energy levels of the X-ray
spectrum, leading to a nonlinear metal effect in CT measurements. Recovering CT
images from metal-affected measurements hence poses a complicated nonlinear
inverse problem where empirical models adopted in previous metal artifact
reduction (MAR) approaches lead to signal loss and strongly aliased
reconstructions. Polyner instead models the MAR problem from a nonlinear
inverse problem perspective. Specifically, we first derive a polychromatic
forward model to accurately simulate the nonlinear CT acquisition process.
Then, we incorporate our forward model into the implicit neural representation
to accomplish reconstruction. Lastly, we adopt a regularizer to preserve the
physical properties of the CT images across different energy levels while
effectively constraining the solution space. Our Polyner is an unsupervised
method and does not require any external training data. Experimenting with
multiple datasets shows that our Polyner achieves comparable or better

feedback to the radiance field reconstruction, thus improving realism in a
3D-consistent fashion. Thereby, rendering artifacts are repaired directly in
the underlying 3D representation by imposing multi-view path rendering

incorporate a denoise and finetune strategy that denoises images rendered from
NeRFs estimated by the hypernetwork and finetunes it while retaining multiview

wild is their reliance on accurate camera poses. Consequently, there is growing
interest in extending NeRF models to jointly optimize camera poses and scene
representation, which offers an alternative to off-the-shelf SfM pipelines
which have well-understood failure modes. Existing approaches for unposed NeRF
operate under limited assumptions, such as a prior pose distribution or coarse
pose initialization, making them less effective in a general setting. In this
work, we propose a novel approach, LU-NeRF, that jointly estimates camera poses
and neural radiance fields with relaxed assumptions on pose configuration. Our
approach operates in a local-to-global manner, where we first optimize over
local subsets of the data, dubbed mini-scenes. LU-NeRF estimates local pose and
geometry for this challenging few-shot task. The mini-scene poses are brought
into a global reference frame through a robust pose synchronization step, where
a final global optimization of pose and scene can be performed. We show our
LU-NeRF pipeline outperforms prior attempts at unposed NeRF without making
restrictive assumptions on the pose prior. This allows us to operate in the

effectiveness of its application in areas such as virtual reality (VR) and
augmented reality (AR) technologies. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can generate
realistic images from any viewpoint. It simultaneously reconstructs the shape,
lighting, and materials of objects, and without surface defects, which breaks
down the barrier between virtuality and reality. The potential spatial
correspondences displayed by NeRF between reconstructed scenes and real-world
scenes offer a wide range of practical applications possibilities. Despite
significant progress in 3D reconstruction since NeRF were introduced, there
remains considerable room for exploration and experimentation. NeRF-based
models are susceptible to interference issues caused by colored ""fog"" noise.
Additionally, they frequently encounter instabilities and failures while
attempting to reconstruct unbounded scenes. Moreover, the model takes a
significant amount of time to converge, making it even more challenging to use
in such scenarios. Our approach, coined Enhance-NeRF, which adopts joint color
to balance low and high reflectivity objects display, utilizes a decoding

Employing monocular depth estimation (MDE) networks, pretrained on large-scale

solving this problem: however, using MDE in conjunction with NeRF comes with a

enhance its robustness and coherence. In addition, we overcome the ambiguity
problems of monocular depths through patch-wise scale-shift fitting and

Most existing methods use pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to
optimize 3D representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) via
latent-space denoising score matching. Yet, these methods often result in
artifacts and inconsistencies across different views due to their suboptimal
optimization approaches and limited understanding of 3D geometry. Moreover, the
inherent constraints of NeRFs in rendering crisp geometry and stable textures
usually lead to a two-stage optimization to attain high-resolution details.
This work proposes holistic sampling and smoothing approaches to achieve
high-quality text-to-3D generation, all in a single-stage optimization. We
compute denoising scores in the text-to-image diffusion model's latent and
image spaces. Instead of randomly sampling timesteps (also referred to as noise
levels in denoising score matching), we introduce a novel timestep annealing
approach that progressively reduces the sampled timestep throughout
optimization. To generate high-quality renderings in a single-stage
optimization, we propose regularization for the variance of z-coordinates along
NeRF rays. To address texture flickering issues in NeRFs, we introduce a kernel
smoothing technique that refines importance sampling weights coarse-to-fine,

performance since they generalise the ability of the entire NeRF pipeline.
Hence, in this paper, we propose a new test framework which isolates the neural
rendering network from the NeRF pipeline and then performs a parametric
evaluation by training and evaluating the NeRF on an explicit radiance field
representation. We also introduce a configurable approach for generating
representations specifically for evaluation purposes. This employs ray-casting
to transform mesh models into explicit NeRF samples, as well as to ""shade""
these representations. Combining these two approaches, we demonstrate how
different ""tasks"" (scenes with different visual effects or learning strategies)

Automation 2023 Workshop on Unconventional Spatial Representations.
  Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are a class of implicit scene representations
that model 3D environments from color images. NeRFs are expressive, and can
model the complex and multi-scale geometry of real world environments, which
potentially makes them a powerful tool for robotics applications. Modern NeRF
training libraries can generate a photo-realistic NeRF from a static data set
in just a few seconds, but are designed for offline use and require a slow pose
optimization pre-computation step.
  In this work we propose NerfBridge, an open-source bridge between the Robot
Operating System (ROS) and the popular Nerfstudio library for real-time, online
training of NeRFs from a stream of images. NerfBridge enables rapid development
of research on applications of NeRFs in robotics by providing an extensible
interface to the efficient training pipelines and model libraries provided by
Nerfstudio. As an example use case we outline a hardware setup that can be used
NerfBridge to train a NeRF from images captured by a camera mounted to a

high-definition maps (HD-Maps) with less human labor, their results are often
unreliable and demonstrate noticeable inconsistencies in the predicted HD-Maps
from different viewpoints. This is because BEV perception is typically set up
in an 'onboard' manner, which restricts the computation and consequently
prevents algorithms from reasoning multiple views simultaneously. This paper
overcomes these limitations and advocates a more practical 'offboard' HD-Map
generation setup that removes the computation constraints, based on the fact
that HD-Maps are commonly reusable infrastructures built offline in data
centers. To this end, we propose a novel offboard pipeline called MV-Map that
capitalizes multi-view consistency and can handle an arbitrary number of frames
with the key design of a 'region-centric' framework. In MV-Map, the target
HD-Maps are created by aggregating all the frames of onboard predictions,
weighted by the confidence scores assigned by an 'uncertainty network'. To
further enhance multi-view consistency, we augment the uncertainty network with
the global 3D structure optimized by a voxelized neural radiance field

borrow the tri-plane representation from EG3D and represent signed distance
fields as a mixture of tri-planes and MLPs instead of representing it with MLPs
only. Using tri-planes leads to a more expressive data structure but will also
introduce noise in the reconstructed surface. The second component is to use a
new type of positional encoding with learnable weights to combat noise in the

several challenges for NeRF-based methods: 1) as for the lip synchronization,
it is hard to generate a long facial motion sequence of high temporal

synthesis by encoding neural representations of a scene. However, NeRFs require
hundreds of images per scene to synthesize photo-realistic novel views.
Training them on sparse input views leads to overfitting and incorrect scene
depth estimation resulting in artifacts in the rendered novel views. Sparse
input NeRFs were recently regularized by providing dense depth estimated from
pre-trained networks as supervision, to achieve improved performance over
sparse depth constraints. However, we find that such depth priors may be
inaccurate due to generalization issues. Instead, we hypothesize that the
visibility of pixels in different input views can be more reliably estimated to
provide dense supervision. In this regard, we compute a visibility prior

successfully train the NeRF with few input views. We reformulate the NeRF to
also directly output the visibility of a 3D point from a given viewpoint to
reduce the training time with the visibility constraint. On multiple datasets,

algorithm-hardware co-design acceleration framework that achieves instant
on-device NeRF training. Our algorithm decomposes the embedding grid
representation in terms of color and density, enabling computational redundancy
to be squeezed out by adopting different (1) grid sizes and (2) update
frequencies for the color and density branches. Our hardware accelerator
further reduces the dominant memory accesses for embedding grid interpolation
by (1) mapping multiple nearby points' memory read requests into one during the
feed-forward process, (2) merging embedding grid updates from the same sliding
time window during back-propagation, and (3) fusing different computation cores
to support the different grid sizes needed by the color and density branches of
Instant-3D algorithm. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
Instant-3D, achieving a large training time reduction of 41x - 248x while
maintaining the same reconstruction quality. Excitingly, Instant-3D has enabled
instant 3D reconstruction for AR/VR, requiring a reconstruction time of only
1.6 seconds per scene and meeting the AR/VR power consumption constraint of 1.9

foundation model which is capable to segment anything in 2D images. This paper
aims to generalize SAM to segment 3D objects. Rather than replicating the data
acquisition and annotation procedure which is costly in 3D, we design an
efficient solution, leveraging the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) as a cheap and
off-the-shelf prior that connects multi-view 2D images to the 3D space. We
refer to the proposed solution as SA3D, for Segment Anything in 3D. It is only
required to provide a manual segmentation prompt (e.g., rough points) for the
target object in a single view, which is used to generate its 2D mask in this
view with SAM. Next, SA3D alternately performs mask inverse rendering and
cross-view self-prompting across various views to iteratively complete the 3D
mask of the target object constructed with voxel grids. The former projects the
2D mask obtained by SAM in the current view onto 3D mask with guidance of the
density distribution learned by the NeRF; The latter extracts reliable prompts
automatically as the input to SAM from the NeRF-rendered 2D mask in another
view. We show in experiments that SA3D adapts to various scenes and achieves 3D
segmentation within minutes. Our research reveals a potential methodology to

new line of methods recently emerged trying to harness diffusion models,

address this issue, we propose Dehazing-NeRF, a method that can recover clear
NeRF from hazy image inputs. Our method simulates the physical imaging process
of hazy images using an atmospheric scattering model, and jointly learns the
atmospheric scattering model and a clean NeRF model for both image dehazing and
novel view synthesis. Different from previous approaches, Dehazing-NeRF is an
unsupervised method with only hazy images as the input, and also does not rely
on hand-designed dehazing priors. By jointly combining the depth estimated from
the NeRF 3D scene with the atmospheric scattering model, our proposed model
breaks through the ill-posed problem of single-image dehazing while maintaining
geometric consistency. Besides, to alleviate the degradation of image quality
caused by information loss, soft margin consistency regularization, as well as
atmospheric consistency and contrast discriminative loss, are addressed during

these challenges, we use NeRF as a differentiable 3D representation, and
introduce a self-supervised Navigation to identify interpretable semantic

dubbed NaviNeRF, is the first work to achieve fine-grained 3D disentanglement
without any priors or supervisions. Specifically, NaviNeRF is built upon the
generative NeRF pipeline, and equipped with an Outer Navigation Branch and an
Inner Refinement Branch. They are complementary -- the outer navigation is to
identify global-view semantic directions, and the inner refinement dedicates to
fine-grained attributes. A synergistic loss is further devised to coordinate
two branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NaviNeRF has a superior
fine-grained 3D disentanglement ability than the previous 3D-aware models. Its

evolve over time under given actions. The intuition, often termed visual
intuitive physics, is a critical ability that allows us to make effective plans
to manipulate the scene to achieve desired outcomes without relying on
extensive trial and error. In this paper, we present a framework capable of
learning 3D-grounded visual intuitive physics models from videos of complex
scenes with fluids. Our method is composed of a conditional Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-style visual frontend and a 3D point-based dynamics prediction
backend, using which we can impose strong relational and structural inductive
bias to capture the structure of the underlying environment. Unlike existing
intuitive point-based dynamics works that rely on the supervision of dense
point trajectory from simulators, we relax the requirements and only assume
access to multi-view RGB images and (imperfect) instance masks acquired using
color prior. This enables the proposed model to handle scenarios where accurate
point estimation and tracking are hard or impossible. We generate datasets
including three challenging scenarios involving fluid, granular materials, and
rigid objects in the simulation. The datasets do not include any dense particle
information so most previous 3D-based intuitive physics pipelines can barely
deal with that. We show our model can make long-horizon future predictions by

holistic shape reconstruction (HSR) of complex objects utilizing a
Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD)-based time-of-flight sensor. As
illustrated in Fig. 1, our method enables new capabilities to reconstruct
near-$360^\circ$ surrounding geometry of an object from a single scan spot. In
such a scenario, traditional line-of-sight (LOS) imaging methods only see the
front part of the object and typically fail to recover the occluded back
regions. Inspired by recent advances of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging
techniques which have demonstrated great power to reconstruct occluded objects,
Omni-LOS marries LOS and NLOS together, leveraging their complementary
advantages to jointly recover the holistic shape of the object from a single
scan position. The core of our method is to put the object nearby diffuse walls
and augment the LOS scan in the front view with the NLOS scans from the
surrounding walls, which serve as virtual ``mirrors'' to trap lights toward the
object. Instead of separately recovering the LOS and NLOS signals, we adopt an
implicit neural network to represent the object, analogous to NeRF and NeTF.
While transients are measured along straight rays in LOS but over the spherical
wavefronts in NLOS, we derive differentiable ray propagation models to
simultaneously model both types of transient measurements so that the NLOS
reconstruction also takes into account the direct LOS measurements and vice
versa. We further develop a proof-of-concept Omni-LOS hardware prototype for
real-world validation. Comprehensive experiments on various wall settings

occlusions, achieves high-fidelity 3D scan quality, and manages to recover

coordinate system based on the object density. While traditional methods like
Structure from Motion are commonly used for camera pose calculation in
pre-processing for NeRFs, the HoloLens offers an interesting interface for
extracting the required input data directly. We present a workflow for
high-resolution 3D reconstructions almost directly from HoloLens data using
NeRFs. Thereby, different investigations are considered: Internal camera poses
from the HoloLens trajectory via a server application, and external camera
poses from Structure from Motion, both with an enhanced variant applied through
pose refinement. Results show that the internal camera poses lead to NeRF
convergence with a PSNR of 25\,dB with a simple rotation around the x-axis and
enable a 3D reconstruction. Pose refinement enables comparable quality compared
to external camera poses, resulting in improved training process with a PSNR of
27\,dB and a better 3D reconstruction. Overall, NeRF reconstructions outperform

arbitrary human performers from sparse multi-view images. A key ingredient of
our method is a hybrid appearance blending module that combines the advantages
of the implicit body NeRF representation and image-based rendering. Existing

shown robustness against the geometric variation of arbitrary human performers.
Yet they often exhibit blurry results when generalized onto unseen identities.
Meanwhile, image-based rendering shows high-quality results when sufficient
observations are available, whereas it suffers artifacts in sparse-view

Current techniques that utilize neural rendering for facilitating free-view

a novel technique, Residual Radiance Field or ReRF, as a highly compact neural
representation to achieve real-time FVV rendering on long-duration dynamic

coordinate-based tiny MLP as the feature decoder. Specifically, ReRF employs a
compact motion grid along with a residual feature grid to exploit inter-frame
feature similarities. We show such a strategy can handle large motions without
sacrificing quality. We further present a sequential training scheme to
maintain the smoothness and the sparsity of the motion/residual grids. Based on
ReRF, we design a special FVV codec that achieves three orders of magnitudes

NeRF, which generates discrete 3D instance masks. The coarse 3D mask prediction
is then projected to image space to match 2D segmentation masks from different

supervise the training of the instance field. Notably, beyond generating
consistent 2D segmentation maps from novel views, Instance NeRF can query

versatile representations for 3D scenes, facilitating various downstream tasks.
However, different architectures, including plain Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Tensors, low-rank Tensors, Hashtables, and their compositions, have their
trade-offs. For instance, Hashtables-based representations allow for faster

editing challenging. To address this limitation and maximize the potential of
each architecture, we propose Progressive Volume Distillation with Active
Learning (PVD-AL), a systematic distillation method that enables any-to-any

provides continuous feedback during the distillation process, resulting in
high-performance results. Empirical evidence is presented to validate our
method on multiple benchmark datasets. For example, PVD-AL can distill an
MLP-based model from a Hashtables-based model at a 10~20X faster speed and
0.8dB~2dB higher PSNR than training the NeRF model from scratch. Moreover,
PVD-AL permits the fusion of diverse features among distinct structures,

Furthermore, we explicitly designed both the world and object models to handle

attributes and different arrangement orders, the hash-table could project the
coordinates into the same distribution for which the mapped signal can be
better modeled using the subsequent INR network, leading to significantly
alleviated spectral bias. Furthermore, the expressive power of the DINER is

different geometrical elements in the attribute space, \textit{e.g.}, 1D curve,
2D curved-plane and 3D curved-volume when the width is set as $1$, $2$ and $3$,

scenes where recovering accurate geometric scaffold and camera pose is
challenging, leading to inferior results using the state-of-the-art stable view

primarily due to (i) over-relying on the multiview stereo (MVS) for geometric

image-based rendering via multiple rotation averaging graph optimization. The
recovered scene depth and the camera-pose help better view-dependent on-surface

number of views are available. To complement the lack of 3D information,
depth-based models, such as DSNeRF and MonoSDF, explicitly assume the
availability of accurate depth maps of multiple views. They linearly scale the
accurate depth maps as supervision to guide the predicted depth of few-shot
NeRFs. However, accurate depth maps are difficult and expensive to capture due
to wide-range depth distances in the wild.
  In this work, we present a new Sparse-view NeRF (SparseNeRF) framework that
exploits depth priors from real-world inaccurate observations. The inaccurate
depth observations are either from pre-trained depth models or coarse depth
maps of consumer-level depth sensors. Since coarse depth maps are not strictly
scaled to the ground-truth depth maps, we propose a simple yet effective
constraint, a local depth ranking method, on NeRFs such that the expected depth
ranking of the NeRF is consistent with that of the coarse depth maps in local
patches. To preserve the spatial continuity of the estimated depth of NeRF, we
further propose a spatial continuity constraint to encourage the consistency of

rendering photo-realistic novel view images from a monocular RGB video of a
dynamic scene. Although it warps moving points across frames from the
observation spaces to a common canonical space for rendering, dynamic NeRF does
not model the change of the reflected color during the warping. As a result,
this approach often fails drastically on challenging specular objects in
motion. We address this limitation by reformulating the neural radiance field
function to be conditioned on surface position and orientation in the
observation space. This allows the specular surface at different poses to keep
the different reflected colors when mapped to the common canonical space.
Additionally, we add the mask of moving objects to guide the deformation field.
As the specular surface changes color during motion, the mask mitigates the
problem of failure to find temporal correspondences with only RGB supervision.
We evaluate our model based on the novel view synthesis quality with a
self-collected dataset of different moving specular objects in realistic
environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the reconstruction quality of moving specular objects

from underfitting with blurred renderings on large-scale scenes due to limited

linear scale-up in training costs and the number of sub-NeRFs as the scene
expands. An alternative solution is to use a feature grid representation, which
is computationally efficient and can naturally scale to a large scene with
increased grid resolutions. However, the feature grid tends to be less

Through a thorough analysis, we demonstrate that this non-trivial task can be
simplified in a new light: When transforming the appearance representation of a

across source views will be seamlessly encoded into the syntheses. That
motivates us to build a concise and flexible learning framework namely LipRF,
which upgrades arbitrary 2D PST methods with Lipschitz mapping tailored for the

the 3D scene, and then emulates the style on each view by 2D PST as the prior
to learn a Lipschitz network to stylize the pre-trained appearance. In view of
that Lipschitz condition highly impacts the expressivity of the neural network,
we devise an adaptive regularization to balance the reconstruction and
stylization. A gradual gradient aggregation strategy is further introduced to

Despite the success of universal optimization-based methods for 2D GAN

high-quality rendering from novel viewpoints. Motivated by the recent
acceleration of NeRF using feature grids, we adopt spherical coordinate instead

better aligns with the rays of egocentric images, and yet enables factorization
for performance enhancement. However, the na\""ive spherical grid suffers from
irregularities at two poles, and also cannot represent unbounded scenes. To
avoid singularities near poles, we combine two balanced grids, which results in
a quasi-uniform angular grid. We also partition the radial grid exponentially

Furthermore, with our resampling technique for grid-based methods, we can
increase the number of valid samples to train NeRF volume. We extensively

SHERF extracts and encodes 3D human representations in canonical space,
enabling rendering and animation from free views and poses. To achieve
high-fidelity novel view and pose synthesis, the encoded 3D human
representations should capture both global appearance and local fine-grained
textures. To this end, we propose a bank of 3D-aware hierarchical features,

has recently made a big leap forward. At the core, NeRF proposes that each 3D
point can emit radiance, allowing to conduct view synthesis using
differentiable volumetric rendering. While neural radiance fields can
accurately represent 3D scenes for computing the image rendering, 3D meshes are
still the main scene representation supported by most computer graphics and
simulation pipelines, enabling tasks such as real time rendering and
physics-based simulations. Obtaining 3D meshes from neural radiance fields
still remains an open challenge since NeRFs are optimized for view synthesis,
not enforcing an accurate underlying geometry on the radiance field. We thus
propose a novel compact and flexible architecture that enables easy 3D surface
reconstruction from any NeRF-driven approach. Upon having trained the radiance
field, we distill the volumetric 3D representation into a Signed Surface
Approximation Network, allowing easy extraction of the 3D mesh and appearance.

the impressive performance of NeRF, where low-dimensional coordinates are
mapped to high-dimensional space to better recover scene details. However,
blindly increasing the frequency of P.E. leads to overfitting when the
reconstruction problem is highly underconstrained, \eg, few-shot images for

challenge, we propose Self-NeRF, a self-evolved NeRF that iteratively refines
the radiance fields with very few number of input views, without incorporating
additional priors. Basically, we train our model under the supervision of
reference and unseen views simultaneously in an iterative procedure. In each
iteration, we label unseen views with the predicted colors or warped pixels
generated by the model from the preceding iteration. However, these expanded
pseudo-views are afflicted by imprecision in color and warping artifacts, which
degrades the performance of NeRF. To alleviate this issue, we construct an
uncertainty-aware NeRF with specialized embeddings. Some techniques such as
cone entropy regularization are further utilized to leverage the pseudo-views

graphics have recently been superseded by neural representations (NR). NRs have
recently been used to learn the geometric and the material properties of the
scenes and use the information to synthesize photorealistic imagery, thereby
promising a replacement for traditional rendering algorithms with scalable
quality and predictable performance. In this work we ask the question: Does
neural graphics (NG) need hardware support? We studied representative NG
applications showing that, if we want to render 4k res. at 60FPS there is a gap
of 1.5X-55X in the desired performance on current GPUs. For AR/VR applications,
there is an even larger gap of 2-4 OOM between the desired performance and the
required system power. We identify that the input encoding and the MLP kernels
are the performance bottlenecks, consuming 72%,60% and 59% of application time
for multi res. hashgrid, multi res. densegrid and low res. densegrid encodings,
respectively. We propose a NG processing cluster, a scalable and flexible
hardware architecture that directly accelerates the input encoding and MLP
kernels through dedicated engines and supports a wide range of NG applications.
We also accelerate the rest of the kernels by fusing them together in Vulkan,
which leads to 9.94X kernel-level performance improvement compared to un-fused
implementation of the pre-processing and the post-processing kernels. Our
results show that, NGPC gives up to 58X end-to-end application-level
performance improvement, for multi res. hashgrid encoding on average across the

the scalability and the overall application potential of the system. In this
paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a set of learnable identity codes to
expand the capability of the framework for multi-identity free-viewpoint

learning various canonical T-pose appearances in a single shared volumetric

scientific computing as their functional representation of partial differential

hash encoding into PINNs to improve the training efficiency, as such encoding
offers a locally-aware (at multi resolution) coordinate inputs to the neural
network. Borrowed from the neural representation field community (NeRF), we
investigate the robustness of calculating the derivatives of such hash encoded
neural networks with respect to the input coordinates, which is often needed by
the PINN loss terms. We propose to replace the automatic differentiation with
finite-difference calculations of the derivatives to address the discontinuous
nature of such derivatives. We also share the appropriate ranges for the hash
encoding hyperparameters to obtain robust derivatives. We test the proposed

rapidly. However, current methods model the whole image as an overall neural
radiance field, which limits the partial semantic editability of synthetic
results. Since NeRF renders an image pixel by pixel, it is possible to split
NeRF in the spatial dimension. We propose a Compositional Neural Radiance Field
(CNeRF) for semantic 3D-aware portrait synthesis and manipulation. CNeRF
divides the image by semantic regions and learns an independent neural radiance
field for each region, and finally fuses them and renders the complete image.
Thus we can manipulate the synthesized semantic regions independently, while
fixing the other parts unchanged. Furthermore, CNeRF is also designed to
decouple shape and texture within each semantic region. Compared to
state-of-the-art 3D-aware GAN methods, our approach enables fine-grained
semantic region manipulation, while maintaining high-quality 3D-consistent

free-viewpoint videos. However, they are inherently unsuitable for interactive
streaming scenarios (e.g. video conferencing, telepresence) because have an
inevitable lag even if the training is instantaneous. This is because these
approaches consume videos and thus have to buffer chunks of frames (often
seconds) before processing. In this work, we take a step towards interactive
streaming via a frame-by-frame approach naturally free of lag. Conventional
wisdom believes that per-frame NeRFs are impractical due to prohibitive
training costs and storage. We break this belief by introducing Incremental
Neural Videos (INV), a per-frame NeRF that is efficiently trained and
streamable. We designed INV based on two insights: (1) Our main finding is that
MLPs naturally partition themselves into Structure and Color Layers, which
store structural and color/texture information respectively. (2) We leverage
this property to retain and improve upon knowledge from previous frames, thus
amortizing training across frames and reducing redundant learning. As a result,
with negligible changes to NeRF, INV can achieve good qualities (>28.6db) in
8min/frame. It can also outperform prior SOTA in 19% less training time.
Additionally, our Temporal Weight Compression reduces the per-frame size to
0.3MB/frame (6.6% of NeRF). More importantly, INV is free from buffer lag and
is naturally fit for streaming. While this work does not achieve real-time
training, it shows that incremental approaches like INV present new
possibilities in interactive 3D streaming. Moreover, our discovery of natural
information partition leads to a better understanding and manipulation of MLPs.

improves upon our baselines, on synthetic and real-world scenes. Our technique

method to effectively suppress cloudy artifacts and geometry noises which arise
easily when the density field is transformed during geometry stylization.

speed for NeRF is extremely slow, limiting the application scenarios of
utilizing NeRF on resource-constrained hardware, such as mobile devices. Many
works have been conducted to reduce the latency of running NeRF models.
However, most of them still require high-end GPU for acceleration or extra

forward pass is performed on a ray to predict the pixel color. Nevertheless, to
reach a similar rendering quality as NeRF, the network in NeLF is designed with
intensive computation, which is not mobile-friendly. In this work, we propose
an efficient network that runs in real-time on mobile devices for neural

pursue high fidelity view synthesis on the challenging scenarios of ultra high
resolutions, building on the methodology of neural radiance fields (NeRF). The
rendering procedure of NeRF-based methods typically relies on a pixel-wise
manner in which rays (or pixels) are treated independently on both training and
inference phases, limiting its representational ability on describing subtle
details, especially when lifting to a extremely high resolution. We address the
issue by exploring ray correlation to enhance high-frequency details recovery.
Particularly, we use the 3D-aware encoder to model geometric information
effectively in a lower resolution space and recover fine details through the
3D-aware decoder, conditioned on ray features and depths estimated by the
encoder. Joint training with patch-based sampling further facilitates our
method incorporating the supervision from perception oriented regularization
beyond pixel-wise loss. Benefiting from the use of geometry-aware local
context, our method can significantly boost rendering quality on high-frequency

methods typically require densely captured images and/or known camera poses,

reconstruction in the wild, this work explores reconstructing general
real-world objects from a few images without known camera poses or object
categories. The crux of our work is solving two fundamental 3D vision problems

approach captures the synergies of these two problems: reliable camera pose
estimation gives rise to accurate shape reconstruction, and the accurate
reconstruction, in turn, induces robust correspondence between different views
and facilitates pose estimation. Our method FORGE predicts 3D features from
each view and leverages them in conjunction with the input images to establish
cross-view correspondence for estimating relative camera poses. The 3D features
are then transformed by the estimated poses into a shared space and are fused
into a neural radiance field. The reconstruction results are rendered by volume
rendering techniques, enabling us to train the model without 3D shape
ground-truth. Our experiments show that FORGE reliably reconstructs objects
from five views. Our pose estimation method outperforms existing ones by a

representation are shown to be very effective for calibrated multi-view

Manhattan scenes to improve the implicit neural radiance field representations.
More precisely, we assume that only the knowledge of the indoor scene (under

whatsoever -- with an unknown Manhattan coordinate frame. Such high-level prior
is used to self-supervise the surface normals derived explicitly in the

thanks to its state-of-the-art (SOTA) rendering quality and wide applications
in Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). However, immersive real-time (> 30
FPS) NeRF based rendering enabled interactions are still limited due to the low
achievable throughput on AR/VR devices. To this end, we first profile SOTA
efficient NeRF algorithms on commercial devices and identify two primary causes
of the aforementioned inefficiency: (1) the uniform point sampling and (2) the
dense accesses and computations of the required embeddings in NeRF.
Furthermore, we propose RT-NeRF, which to the best of our knowledge is the
first algorithm-hardware co-design acceleration of NeRF. Specifically, on the
algorithm level, RT-NeRF integrates an efficient rendering pipeline for largely
alleviating the inefficiency due to the commonly adopted uniform point sampling
method in NeRF by directly computing the geometry of pre-existing points.
Additionally, RT-NeRF leverages a coarse-grained view-dependent computing
ordering scheme for eliminating the (unnecessary) processing of invisible
points. On the hardware level, our proposed RT-NeRF accelerator (1) adopts a
hybrid encoding scheme to adaptively switch between a bitmap- or
coordinate-based sparsity encoding format for NeRF's sparse embeddings, aiming
to maximize the storage savings and thus reduce the required DRAM accesses
while supporting efficient NeRF decoding; and (2) integrates both a
dual-purpose bi-direction adder & search tree and a high-density sparse search

datasets provide collections of single monocular views per timestamp sampled
from multiple (virtual) cameras. We refer to this form of inputs as
""monocularized"" data. Existing work shows impressive results for synthetic

speed and angular range for generating novel views. This paper addresses these
limitations and proposes a new method for full 360{\deg} inward-facing novel

1) An efficient deformation module that decouples the processing of spatial and
temporal information for accelerated training and inference; and 2) A static
module representing the canonical scene as a fast hash-encoded neural radiance
field. In addition to existing synthetic monocularized data, we systematically
analyze the performance on real-world inward-facing scenes using a newly

Here, we make the first attempt to achieve generic text-guided cross-category

downstream tasks like spatial-relation-aware editing. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Volume Distillation (PVD), a systematic distillation method that

residual density parameterized by the geometry. In the first stage, we focus on
geometry reconstruction based on SDF representation, which would lead to a good
geometry surface of the scene and also a sharp density. In the second stage,
the residual density is learned based on the SDF learned in the first stage for
encoding more details about the appearance. In this way, our method can better
learn the density distribution with the geometry prior for high-fidelity novel
view synthesis while preserving the 3D structures. Experiments on large-scale

on this topic. First, we equip text-guided diffusion models to achieve
3D-consistent generation. Specifically, we integrate a NeRF-like neural field
to generate low-resolution coarse results for a given camera view. Such results
can provide 3D priors as condition information for the following diffusion
process. During denoising diffusion, we further enhance the 3D consistency by
modeling cross-view correspondences with a novel two-stream (corresponding to
two different views) asynchronous diffusion process. Second, we study 3D local
editing and propose a two-step solution that can generate 360-degree
manipulated results by editing an object from a single view. Step 1, we propose
to perform 2D local editing by blending the predicted noises. Step 2, we
conduct a noise-to-text inversion process that maps 2D blended noises into the
view-independent text embedding space. Once the corresponding text embedding is
obtained, 360-degree images can be generated. Last but not least, we extend our
model to perform one-shot novel view synthesis by fine-tuning on a single
image, firstly showing the potential of leveraging text guidance for novel view

view synthesis. While NeRFs are quickly being adapted for a wider set of
applications, intuitively editing NeRF scenes is still an open challenge. One
important editing task is the removal of unwanted objects from a 3D scene, such
that the replaced region is visually plausible and consistent with its context.
We refer to this task as 3D inpainting. In 3D, solutions must be both
consistent across multiple views and geometrically valid. In this paper, we
propose a novel 3D inpainting method that addresses these challenges. Given a
small set of posed images and sparse annotations in a single input image, our
framework first rapidly obtains a 3D segmentation mask for a target object.
Using the mask, a perceptual optimizationbased approach is then introduced that
leverages learned 2D image inpainters, distilling their information into 3D
space, while ensuring view consistency. We also address the lack of a diverse
benchmark for evaluating 3D scene inpainting methods by introducing a dataset
comprised of challenging real-world scenes. In particular, our dataset contains
views of the same scene with and without a target object, enabling more
principled benchmarking of the 3D inpainting task. We first demonstrate the
superiority of our approach on multiview segmentation, comparing to NeRFbased
methods and 2D segmentation approaches. We then evaluate on the task of 3D
inpainting, establishing state-ofthe-art performance against other NeRF
manipulation algorithms, as well as a strong 2D image inpainter baseline.

NeRF model to generate a 3D object. We adapt the score distillation to the
publicly available, and computationally efficient, Latent Diffusion Models,
which apply the entire diffusion process in a compact latent space of a
pretrained autoencoder. As NeRFs operate in image space, a naive solution for
guiding them with latent score distillation would require encoding to the
latent space at each guidance step. Instead, we propose to bring the NeRF to

show that while Text-to-3D models can generate impressive results, they are

guide our Latent-NeRF using a Sketch-Shape: an abstract geometry that defines
the coarse structure of the desired object. Then, we present means to integrate
such a constraint directly into a Latent-NeRF. This unique combination of text
and shape guidance allows for increased control over the generation process. We
also show that latent score distillation can be successfully applied directly

This work presents an end-to-end, learning-based inverse rendering framework

The framework takes a single image as input to jointly recover the underlying
geometry, spatially-varying lighting, and photorealistic materials.
Specifically, we introduce a physically-based differentiable rendering layer
with screen-space ray tracing, resulting in more realistic specular reflections
that match the input photo. In addition, we create a large-scale,
photorealistic indoor scene dataset with significantly richer details like
complex furniture and dedicated decorations. Further, we design a novel

hypernetwork-based neural radiance fields to predict lighting outside the view

image into the latent space of these 3D-aware GANs has a natural advantage over
2D GAN inversion: not only does it allow multi-view consistent editing of the
projected image, but it also enables 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis
when given only a single image. However, the explicit viewpoint control acts as
a main hindrance in the 3D GAN inversion process, as both camera pose and
latent code have to be optimized simultaneously to reconstruct the given image.
Most works that explore the latent space of the 3D-aware GANs rely on
ground-truth camera viewpoint or deformable 3D model, thus limiting their
applicability. In this work, we introduce a generalizable 3D GAN inversion
method that infers camera viewpoint and latent code simultaneously to enable
multi-view consistent semantic image editing. The key to our approach is to
leverage pre-trained estimators for better initialization and utilize the
pixel-wise depth calculated from NeRF parameters to better reconstruct the
given image. We conduct extensive experiments on image reconstruction and
editing both quantitatively and qualitatively, and further compare our results

the first time, propose a multiview RGB-based 6-DoF grasp detection network,
GraspNeRF, that leverages the generalizable neural radiance field (NeRF) to
achieve material-agnostic object grasping in clutter. Compared to the existing
NeRF-based 3-DoF grasp detection methods that rely on densely captured input
images and time-consuming per-scene optimization, our system can perform
zero-shot NeRF construction with sparse RGB inputs and reliably detect 6-DoF
grasps, both in real-time. The proposed framework jointly learns generalizable
NeRF and grasp detection in an end-to-end manner, optimizing the scene
representation construction for the grasping. For training data, we generate a

novel view synthesis, often need dense input views. Many papers train one model

important setting: can we train one model that can represent multiple scenes,

views to few extremely sparse and almost non-overlapping views. To deal with
it, X-NeRF, a fully explicit approach which learns a general scene completion

insufficient RGB-D input views, X-NeRF first transforms them to a sparse point
cloud tensor and then applies a 3D sparse generative Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) to complete it to an explicit radiance field whose volumetric
rendering can be conducted fast without running networks during inference. To
avoid overfitting, besides common rendering loss, we apply perceptual loss as

representation from multi-view (MV) images. Yet, it cannot handle multi-scale

multi-view images captured from a day-to-day commodity camera. Although
recently proposed Mip-NeRF could handle multi-scale imaging problems with NeRF,
it cannot handle camera pose estimation error. On the other hand, the newly
proposed BARF can solve the camera pose problem with NeRF but fails if the

crucial to have precise camera-pose estimates. Without considering robustness

Most methods use a holistic representation to jointly model the body and

applications like virtual try-on. Other methods separately model the body and
clothing, but they require training from a large set of 3D clothed human meshes

We integrate the pose extraction and view synthesis into a single end-to-end

photo-realistic 2D images while capturing decent underlying 3D shapes. A
popular solution is to adopt the generative adversarial network (GAN) and
replace the generator with a 3D renderer, where volume rendering with neural
radiance field (NeRF) is commonly used. Despite the advancement of synthesis
quality, existing methods fail to obtain moderate 3D shapes. We argue that,
considering the two-player game in the formulation of GANs, only making the
generator 3D-aware is not enough. In other words, displacing the generative
mechanism only offers the capability, but not the guarantee, of producing
3D-aware images, because the supervision of the generator primarily comes from
the discriminator. To address this issue, we propose GeoD through learning a
geometry-aware discriminator to improve 3D-aware GANs. Concretely, besides
differentiating real and fake samples from the 2D image space, the
discriminator is additionally asked to derive the geometry information from the
inputs, which is then applied as the guidance of the generator. Such a simple
yet effective design facilitates learning substantially more accurate 3D
shapes. Extensive experiments on various generator architectures and training
datasets verify the superiority of GeoD over state-of-the-art alternatives.
Moreover, our approach is registered as a general framework such that a more

Existing methods have demonstrated the potential in single-view view synthesis.
However, they still fail to recover the fine appearance details, especially in
self-occluded areas. This is because a single view only provides limited

appearances, which introduce additional prior knowledge. Motivated by this, we

takes the pixel-aligned image features and the corresponding symmetric features
as extra inputs to the NeRF, whose parameters are generated by a hypernetwork.
As the parameters are conditioned on the image-encoded latent codes, SymmNeRF
is thus scene-independent and can generalize to new scenes. Experiments on

Moreover, the recent advances in neural radiance fields, are revolutionising
novel-view synthesis of known scenes. In this work, we present a facial 3D
Morphable Model, which exploits both of the above, and can accurately model a
subject's identity, pose and expression and render it in arbitrary
illumination. This is achieved by utilizing a powerful deep style-based
generator to overcome two main weaknesses of neural radiance fields, their
rigidity and rendering speed. We introduce a style-based generative network
that synthesizes in one pass all and only the required rendering samples of a
neural radiance field. We create a vast labelled synthetic dataset of facial
renders, and train the network on these data, so that it can accurately model
and generalize on facial identity, pose and appearance. Finally, we show that
this model can accurately be fit to ""in-the-wild"" facial images of arbitrary
pose and illumination, extract the facial characteristics, and be used to
re-render the face in controllable conditions.";Stathis Galanakis<author:sep>Baris Gecer<author:sep>Alexandros Lattas<author:sep>Stefanos Zafeiriou;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07366v1;cs.CV;;

by learning a per-frame embedding, but this operation does not generalize to
unseen poses. Given that the lighting condition is static in the world space
while the human body is consistent in the canonical space, we propose a
dual-space NeRF that models the scene lighting and the human body with two MLPs

rely on the linear blend skinning (LBS) algorithm. However, the blending

NeRF-based method capable of reconstruction and expression editing of 3D faces
based on a small number of dynamic images. Unlike existing dynamic NeRFs that
require dense images as input and can only be modeled for a single identity,
our method enables face reconstruction across different persons with few-shot
inputs. Compared to state-of-the-art few-shot NeRFs designed for modeling
static scenes, the proposed FDNeRF accepts view-inconsistent dynamic inputs and
supports arbitrary facial expression editing, i.e., producing faces with novel
expressions beyond the input ones. To handle the inconsistencies between
dynamic inputs, we introduce a well-designed conditional feature warping (CFW)
module to perform expression conditioned warping in 2D feature space, which is
also identity adaptive and 3D constrained. As a result, features of different
expressions are transformed into the target ones. We then construct a radiance
field based on these view-consistent features and use volumetric rendering to
synthesize novel views of the modeled faces. Extensive experiments with
quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing dynamic and few-shot NeRFs on both 3D face reconstruction and

a denser set of reference images of a single scene to produce accurate novel

Field (NeRF) has showcased significant progress in synthesizing novel views,
unlocking the potential for immersive scene exploration. Nevertheless, previous

noticeable performance degradation when applied to outward-facing and
large-scale scenes due to limitations in scene parameterization. To achieve
seamless and real-time indoor roaming, we propose a novel approach using
geometry-aware radiance fields with adaptively assigned local radiance fields.
Initially, we employ multiple 360$^\circ$ images of an indoor scene to
progressively reconstruct explicit geometry in the form of a probabilistic
occupancy map, derived from a global omnidirectional radiance field.
Subsequently, we assign local radiance fields through an adaptive
divide-and-conquer strategy based on the recovered geometry. By incorporating
geometry-aware sampling and decomposition of the global radiance field, our
system effectively utilizes positional encoding and compact neural networks to
enhance rendering quality and speed. Additionally, the extracted floorplan of
the scene aids in providing visual guidance, contributing to a realistic
roaming experience. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, we curated

DoF-NeRF, a novel neural rendering approach that can deal with shallow DoF

the aperture of lens following the principles of geometric optics. Such a
physical guarantee allows DoF-NeRF to operate views with different focus

existing compression methods encode the set of light field sub-aperture images,
our proposed method learns an implicit scene representation in the form of a

Tensor Train (TT) decomposition within an Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM) optimization framework. To further reduce the model's size,
the components of the tensor train decomposition need to be quantized. However,
simultaneously considering the optimization of the NeRF model with both the
low-rank constraint and rate-constrained weight quantization is challenging. To
address this difficulty, we introduce a network distillation operation that
separates the low-rank approximation and the weight quantization during network
training. The information from the initial LR-constrained NeRF (LR-NeRF) is
distilled into a model of much smaller dimension (DLR-NeRF) based on the TT
decomposition of the LR-NeRF. We then learn an optimized global codebook to
quantize all TT components, producing the final QDLR-NeRF. Experimental results

feature modulation procedure. In this way, the feature modulation enhances the
transformers with the NeRF-like inductive bias. On the other hand, NeRFA
performs multi-stage attention to reduce the computational overhead.
Furthermore, the NeRFA model adopts the ray and pixel transformers to learn the
interactions between rays and pixels. NeRFA demonstrates superior performance

GNT achieves neural representation and rendering that generalizes across scenes

predicts coordinate-aligned features by aggregating information from epipolar
lines on the neighboring views. (2) The ray transformer renders novel views
using attention to decode the features from the view transformer along the

perform volume rendering. This novel 3D representation allows the network to
reconstruct unseen regions without enforcing constraints like symmetry or
canonical coordinate systems. Our method can render novel views from only a

have enabled photo-realistic novel view synthesis. However, in their standard
form, NeRFs do not support the editing of objects, such as a human head, within
a scene. In this work, we propose RigNeRF, a system that goes beyond just novel
view synthesis and enables full control of head pose and facial expressions
learned from a single portrait video. We model changes in head pose and facial
expressions using a deformation field that is guided by a 3D morphable face
model (3DMM). The 3DMM effectively acts as a prior for RigNeRF that learns to
predict only residuals to the 3DMM deformations and allows us to render novel
(rigid) poses and (non-rigid) expressions that were not present in the input
sequence. Using only a smartphone-captured short video of a subject for
training, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on free view synthesis
of a portrait scene with explicit head pose and expression controls. The

radiance field conditioned on observed-view images for the novel view synthesis
task. By contrast, existing MLP-based NeRFs are not able to directly receive
observed views with an arbitrary number and require an auxiliary pooling-based
operation to fuse source-view information, resulting in the missing of
complicated relationships between source views and the target rendering view.
Furthermore, current approaches process each 3D point individually and ignore
the local consistency of a radiance field scene representation. These
limitations potentially can reduce their performance in challenging real-world
applications where large differences between source views and a novel rendering
view may exist. To address these challenges, our TransNeRF utilizes the
attention mechanism to naturally decode deep associations of an arbitrary
number of source views into a coordinate-based scene representation. Local
consistency of shape and appearance are considered in the ray-cast space and
the surrounding-view space within a unified Transformer network. Experiments
demonstrate that our TransNeRF, trained on a wide variety of scenes, can
achieve better performance in comparison to state-of-the-art image-based neural
rendering methods in both scene-agnostic and per-scene finetuning scenarios

we formulate an optimization problem that jointly inpaints the image content in

for learning the where component. To achieve this, we propose an efficient,
voxelised approximation approach to recover the object shape directly from a

composition of NeRFs, richly representing individual objects. To evaluate the
quality of the learned representations, ObPose is evaluated quantitatively on
the YCB, MultiShapeNet, and CLEVR datatasets for unsupervised scene
segmentation, outperforming the current state-of-the-art in 3D scene inference

fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Neural approaches such
as NeRF have achieved photorealistic results on novel view synthesis, but they
require known camera poses. Solving this problem with unknown camera poses is
highly challenging as it requires joint optimization over shape, radiance, and
pose. This problem is exacerbated when the input images are captured in the
wild with varying backgrounds and illuminations. Standard pose estimation
techniques fail in such image collections in the wild due to very few estimated
correspondences across images. Furthermore, NeRF cannot relight a scene under
any illumination, as it operates on radiance (the product of reflectance and
illumination). We propose a joint optimization framework to estimate the shape,
BRDF, and per-image camera pose and illumination. Our method works on
in-the-wild online image collections of an object and produces relightable 3D

a practical and useful technique for many real-world applications. Recently,
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a rendering technique that uses neural networks
to approximate classical ray tracing, have been considered as one of the
promising approaches for synthesizing novel views from a sparse set of images.
We find that NeRF can render new views while maintaining geometric consistency,
but it does not properly maintain skin details, such as moles and pores. These
details are important particularly for faces because when we look at an image
of a face, we are much more sensitive to details than when we look at other
objects. On the other hand, 3D Morpable Models (3DMMs) based on traditional
meshes and textures can perform well in terms of skin detail despite that it
has less precise geometry and cannot cover the head and the entire scene with
background. Based on these observations, we propose a method to use both NeRF
and 3DMM to synthesize a high-fidelity novel view of a scene with a face. Our
method learns a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to mix a NeRF-synthesized

image or video stylization to 3D scenes cannot achieve such consistency. Thanks
to recently proposed neural radiance fields (NeRF), we are able to represent a
3D scene in a consistent way. Consistent 3D scene stylization can be
effectively achieved by stylizing the corresponding NeRF. However, there is a
significant domain gap between style examples which are 2D images and NeRF
which is an implicit volumetric representation. To address this problem, we
propose a novel mutual learning framework for 3D scene stylization that
combines a 2D image stylization network and NeRF to fuse the stylization
ability of 2D stylization network with the 3D consistency of NeRF. We first
pre-train a standard NeRF of the 3D scene to be stylized and replace its color
prediction module with a style network to obtain a stylized NeRF. It is
followed by distilling the prior knowledge of spatial consistency from NeRF to
the 2D stylization network through an introduced consistency loss. We also
introduce a mimic loss to supervise the mutual learning of the NeRF style
module and fine-tune the 2D stylization decoder. In order to further make our
model handle ambiguities of 2D stylization results, we introduce learnable
latent codes that obey the probability distributions conditioned on the style.
They are attached to training samples as conditional inputs to better learn the
style module in our novel stylized NeRF. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method is superior to existing approaches in both visual quality and
long-range consistency.";Yi-Hua Huang<author:sep>Yue He<author:sep>Yu-Jie Yuan<author:sep>Yu-Kun Lai<author:sep>Lin Gao;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12183v2;cs.GR;Accepted by CVPR 2022;nerf

pose-based code models the shape of the performer whereas the latter point

representation combining a canonical NeRF and a volume deformation scheme.
Using a canonical space enables our method to learn shared properties of human

connect the canonical space with input and target images and query image
features for radiance and density prediction. We leverage the parametric 3D

2203.05189v2;http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05189v2;2022-03-10;NeRFocus: Neural Radiance Field for 3D Synthetic Defocus;"Neural radiance fields (NeRF) bring a new wave for 3D interactive
experiences. However, as an important part of the immersive experiences, the
defocus effects have not been fully explored within NeRF. Some recent
NeRF-based methods generate 3D defocus effects in a post-process fashion by
utilizing multiplane technology. Still, they are either time-consuming or
memory-consuming. This paper proposes a novel thin-lens-imaging-based NeRF
framework that can directly render various 3D defocus effects, dubbed NeRFocus.
Unlike the pinhole, the thin lens refracts rays of a scene point, so its
imaging on the sensor plane is scattered as a circle of confusion (CoC). A
direct solution sampling enough rays to approximate this process is
computationally expensive. Instead, we propose to inverse the thin lens imaging
to explicitly model the beam path for each point on the sensor plane and
generalize this paradigm to the beam path of each pixel, then use the
frustum-based volume rendering to render each pixel's beam path. We further
design an efficient probabilistic training (p-training) strategy to simplify
the training process vastly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
NeRFocus can achieve various 3D defocus effects with adjustable camera pose,
focus distance, and aperture size. Existing NeRF can be regarded as our special
case by setting aperture size as zero to render large depth-of-field images.
Despite such merits, NeRFocus does not sacrifice NeRF's original performance
(e.g., training and inference time, parameter consumption, rendering quality),
which implies its great potential for broader application and further
improvement. Code and video are available at

long-standing problem in computer vision. Existing deep learning approaches for
6D pose estimation typically rely on the assumption of availability of 3D
object models and 6D pose annotations. However, precise annotation of 6D poses
in real data is intricate, time-consuming and not scalable, while synthetic
data scales well but lacks realism. To avoid these problems, we present a
weakly-supervised reconstruction-based pipeline, named NeRF-Pose, which needs
only 2D object segmentation and known relative camera poses during training.
Following the first-reconstruct-then-regress idea, we first reconstruct the
objects from multiple views in the form of an implicit neural representation.
Then, we train a pose regression network to predict pixel-wise 2D-3D
correspondences between images and the reconstructed model. At inference, the
approach only needs a single image as input. A NeRF-enabled PnP+RANSAC
algorithm is used to estimate stable and accurate pose from the predicted
correspondences. Experiments on LineMod and LineMod-Occlusion show that the
proposed method has state-of-the-art accuracy in comparison to the best 6D pose
estimation methods in spite of being trained only with weak labels. Besides, we

according to its accumulated refractive point and normal, and we employ the
correspondences and uniqueness of refracted ray for NeReF optimization. We show
NeReF, as a global optimization scheme, can more robustly tackle refraction
distortions detrimental to traditional methods for correspondence matching.
Furthermore, the continuous NeReF representation of wavefront enables view

virtual reality and digital entertainment. While most previous studies rely on
accurate explicit structural information, recent works explore the implicit
scene representation of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for realistic generation.
In order to capture the inconsistent motions as well as the semantic difference
between human head and torso, some work models them via two individual sets of
NeRF, leading to unnatural results. In this work, we propose Semantic-aware
Speaking Portrait NeRF (SSP-NeRF), which creates delicate audio-driven
portraits using one unified set of NeRF. The proposed model can handle the
detailed local facial semantics and the global head-torso relationship through
two semantic-aware modules. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Aware
Dynamic Ray Sampling module with an additional parsing branch that facilitates
audio-driven volume rendering. Moreover, to enable portrait rendering in one
unified neural radiance field, a Torso Deformation module is designed to
stabilize the large-scale non-rigid torso motions. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our proposed approach renders more realistic video portraits

faithfully reconstructed and rendered, but also plausible material parameters

recent advances in model-free, dynamic Neural Radiance Fields, we reconstruct
the objects and corresponding deformation fields. We propose to use a
differentiable, particle-based simulator to use these deformation fields to
find representative material parameters, which enable us to run new

specialized sensors (e.g., synchronized multi-camera systems), or pre-built 3D
deformable models (e.g., SMAL or SMPL). Such methods are not able to scale to
diverse sets of objects in the wild. We present BANMo, a method that requires
neither a specialized sensor nor a pre-defined template shape. BANMo builds
high-fidelity, articulated 3D models (including shape and animatable skinning
weights) from many monocular casual videos in a differentiable rendering
framework. While the use of many videos provides more coverage of camera views
and object articulations, they introduce significant challenges in establishing
correspondence across scenes with different backgrounds, illumination

classic deformable shape models that make use of articulated bones and blend
skinning, (2) volumetric neural radiance fields (NeRFs) that are amenable to
gradient-based optimization, and (3) canonical embeddings that generate
correspondences between pixels and an articulated model. We introduce neural
blend skinning models that allow for differentiable and invertible articulated
deformations. When combined with canonical embeddings, such models allow us to
establish dense correspondences across videos that can be self-supervised with

  To address these challenges, we begin by analyzing visibility statistics for

Hence we employ only a rough volumetric representation using a pose-conditioned

conditioning via applying a learned deformation field to the positional

reduce the number of sampling points and speed up the rendering process.

synthesis from a collection of posed input images. Like most view synthesis
methods, NeRF uses tonemapped low dynamic range (LDR) as input; these images
have been processed by a lossy camera pipeline that smooths detail, clips
highlights, and distorts the simple noise distribution of raw sensor data. We
modify NeRF to instead train directly on linear raw images, preserving the
scene's full dynamic range. By rendering raw output images from the resulting
NeRF, we can perform novel high dynamic range (HDR) view synthesis tasks. In
addition to changing the camera viewpoint, we can manipulate focus, exposure,
and tonemapping after the fact. Although a single raw image appears
significantly more noisy than a postprocessed one, we show that NeRF is highly
robust to the zero-mean distribution of raw noise. When optimized over many
noisy raw inputs (25-200), NeRF produces a scene representation so accurate
that its rendered novel views outperform dedicated single and multi-image deep
raw denoisers run on the same wide baseline input images. As a result, our

applications are being developed. However, NeRF's big limitation is its slow
speed. Many attempts are made to speeding up NeRF training and inference,
including intricate code-level optimization and caching, use of sophisticated
data structures, and amortization through multi-task and meta learning. In this
work, we revisit the basic building blocks of NeRF through the lens of classic
techniques before NeRF. We propose Voxel-Accelearated NeRF (VaxNeRF),
integrating NeRF with visual hull, a classic 3D reconstruction technique only
requiring binary foreground-background pixel labels per image. Visual hull,
which can be optimized in about 10 seconds, can provide coarse in-out field
separation to omit substantial amounts of network evaluations in NeRF. We
provide a clean fully-pythonic, JAX-based implementation on the popular JaxNeRF
codebase, consisting of only about 30 lines of code changes and a modular
visual hull subroutine, and achieve about 2-8x faster learning on top of the
highly-performative JaxNeRF baseline with zero degradation in rendering
quality. With sufficient compute, this effectively brings down full NeRF
training from hours to 30 minutes. We hope VaxNeRF -- a careful combination of
a classic technique with a deep method (that arguably replaced it) -- can

intervals, one per voxel; components of the volume rendering integral are
estimated from the features for each interval using an MLP, and the components
are aggregated. As a result, DIVeR can render thin translucent structures that
are missed by other integrators. Furthermore, DIVeR's representation has
semantics that is relatively exposed compared to other such methods -- moving
feature vectors around in the voxel space results in natural edits. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative comparisons to current state-of-the-art methods

fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. Neural approaches such as

decomposition but struggle to accurately recover detailed illumination, thereby
significantly limiting realism. We propose a novel reflectance decomposition

illumination integral operation in the rendering with a simple network query.
In addition, we also learn deep low-dimensional priors on BRDF and illumination

the conventional volume rendering method causes inherent geometric errors (i.e.
bias) for surface reconstruction, and therefore propose a new formulation that

While existing works demonstrated compelling rendering of static scenes and
playback of dynamic scenes, photo-realistic reconstruction and rendering of
humans with neural implicit methods, in particular under user-controlled novel
poses, is still difficult. To address this problem, we utilize a coarse body
model as the proxy to unwarp the surrounding 3D space into a canonical pose. A
neural radiance field learns pose-dependent geometric deformations and pose-
and view-dependent appearance effects in the canonical space from multi-view
video input. To synthesize novel views of high fidelity dynamic geometry and
appearance, we leverage 2D texture maps defined on the body model as latent
variables for predicting residual deformations and the dynamic appearance.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better quality than the
state-of-the-arts on playback as well as novel pose synthesis, and can even
generalize well to new poses that starkly differ from the training poses.

reflectance of an object from multi-view images (and their camera poses) of an
object illuminated by one unknown lighting condition. This enables the
rendering of novel views of the object under arbitrary environment lighting and
editing of the object's material properties. The key to our approach, which we
call Neural Radiance Factorization (NeRFactor), is to distill the volumetric
geometry of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) [Mildenhall et al. 2020]
representation of the object into a surface representation and then jointly
refine the geometry while solving for the spatially-varying reflectance and
environment lighting. Specifically, NeRFactor recovers 3D neural fields of
surface normals, light visibility, albedo, and Bidirectional Reflectance
Distribution Functions (BRDFs) without any supervision, using only a
re-rendering loss, simple smoothness priors, and a data-driven BRDF prior
learned from real-world BRDF measurements. By explicitly modeling light
visibility, NeRFactor is able to separate shadows from albedo and synthesize
realistic soft or hard shadows under arbitrary lighting conditions. NeRFactor
is able to recover convincing 3D models for free-viewpoint relighting in this

solution is to combine existing novel view synthesis and image/video style
transfer approaches, which often leads to blurry results or inconsistent
appearance. Inspired by the high-quality results of the neural radiance fields

the desired style. Our framework consists of two components: an implicit
representation of the 3D scene with the neural radiance fields model, and a
hypernetwork to transfer the style information into the scene representation.
In particular, our implicit representation model disentangles the scene into
the geometry and appearance branches, and the hypernetwork learns to predict
the parameters of the appearance branch from the reference style image. To
alleviate the training difficulties and memory burden, we propose a two-stage
training procedure and a patch sub-sampling approach to optimize the style and
content losses with the neural radiance fields model. After optimization, our

scalability to high resolution. However, the heavy computation required by its
volumetric approach prevents NeRF from being useful in practice; minutes are
taken to render a single image of a few megapixels. Now, an image of a scene
can be rendered in a level-of-detail manner, so we posit that a complicated
region of the scene should be represented by a large neural network while a
small neural network is capable of encoding a simple region, enabling a balance

The core of Recursive-NeRF learns uncertainties for query coordinates,
representing the quality of the predicted color and volumetric intensity at

next level to a bigger neural network with a more powerful representational

Storage of such a 3D scene can be done in two ways; (1) storing 2D images taken

views from all directions. So far, traditional 3D compression methods have
focused on the first type of storage and compressed the original 2D images with
image compression techniques. With this approach, the user first decodes the
stored 2D images and then renders the 3D scene. However, this separated
procedure is inefficient since a large amount of 2D images have to be stored.
In this work, we take a different approach and compress a functional

non-rigidly deforming scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of
deformation fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space,
thereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they
represent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field,
which makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these

introduce neural blend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based
on the skeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D human
skeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observation
correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can
regularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blend
weight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate new

core of our approach is a new layered neural representation, where each dynamic
entity including the environment itself is formulated into a space-time
coherent neural layered radiance representation called ST-NeRF. Such layered
representation supports fully perception and realistic manipulation of the
dynamic scene whilst still supporting a free viewing experience in a wide

or better than state of the art on three 2D image segmentation benchmarks, we
apply it to two multi-object 3D datasets: A multiview version of CLEVR, and a
novel dataset in which scenes are populated by ShapeNet models. We find that
after training ObSuRF on RGB-D views of training scenes, it is capable of not
only recovering the 3D geometry of a scene depicted in a single input image,

images. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) learn a continuous volumetric
representation of a scene through multi-view consistency, and can be rendered
from novel viewpoints by ray casting. While NeRF has an impressive ability to
reconstruct geometry and fine details given many images, up to 100 for
challenging 360{\deg} scenes, it often finds a degenerate solution to its image
reconstruction objective when only a few input views are available. To improve
few-shot quality, we propose DietNeRF. We introduce an auxiliary semantic
consistency loss that encourages realistic renderings at novel poses. DietNeRF
is trained on individual scenes to (1) correctly render given input views from
the same pose, and (2) match high-level semantic attributes across different,
random poses. Our semantic loss allows us to supervise DietNeRF from arbitrary
poses. We extract these semantics using a pre-trained visual encoder such as
CLIP, a Vision Transformer trained on hundreds of millions of diverse
single-view, 2D photographs mined from the web with natural language
supervision. In experiments, DietNeRF improves the perceptual quality of
few-shot view synthesis when learned from scratch, can render novel views with

synthesis. While achieving compelling results, most approaches operate in the
two-dimensional image domain, ignoring the three-dimensional nature of our

3D-aware, i.e., scenes are modeled in 3D and then rendered differentiably to
the image plane. This leads to impressive 3D consistency, but incorporating
such a bias comes at a price: the camera needs to be modeled as well. Current
approaches assume fixed intrinsics and a predefined prior over camera pose
ranges. As a result, parameter tuning is typically required for real-world
data, and results degrade if the data distribution is not matched. Our key
hypothesis is that learning a camera generator jointly with the image generator
leads to a more principled approach to 3D-aware image synthesis. Further, we
propose to decompose the scene into a background and foreground model, leading
to more efficient and disentangled scene representations. While training from
raw, unposed image collections, we learn a 3D- and camera-aware generative

displays and commercial VR platforms. Such displays require low latency and
high quality rendering of synthetic imagery with reduced compute overheads.
Recent advances in neural rendering showed promise of unlocking new
possibilities in 3D computer graphics via image-based representations of
virtual or physical environments. Specifically, the neural radiance fields
(NeRF) demonstrated that photo-realistic quality and continuous view changes of
3D scenes can be achieved without loss of view-dependent effects. While NeRF
can significantly benefit rendering for VR applications, it faces unique
challenges posed by high field-of-view, high resolution, and
stereoscopic/egocentric viewing, typically causing low quality and high latency
of the rendered images. In VR, this not only harms the interaction experience
but may also cause sickness. To tackle these problems toward
six-degrees-of-freedom, egocentric, and stereo NeRF in VR, we present the first
gaze-contingent 3D neural representation and view synthesis method. We
incorporate the human psychophysics of visual- and stereo-acuity into an
egocentric neural representation of 3D scenery. We then jointly optimize the
latency/performance and visual quality while mutually bridging human perception
and neural scene synthesis to achieve perceptually high-quality immersive
interaction. We conducted both objective analysis and subjective studies to
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. We find that our method
significantly reduces latency (up to 99% time reduction compared with NeRF)

The intrinsic multi-view consistency and smoothness of NeRF benefit semantics
by enabling sparse labels to efficiently propagate. We show the benefit of this

free-viewpoint rendering of scenes with arbitrary geometry and view-dependent

PlenOctree. In order to preserve view-dependent effects such as specularities,
we factorize the appearance via closed-form spherical basis functions.
Specifically, we show that it is possible to train NeRFs to predict a spherical

directly estimating depth. The combination of these techniques leads to DONeRF,

involves redundancy in data representation. Mathematically this may be achieved
by redundancy through the use of frames. One way to measure the robustness of a
frame against erasures is to examine the worst case condition number of the
frame with a certain number of vectors erased from the frame. The term {\em
numerically erasure-robust frames (NERFs)} was introduced in \cite{FicMix12} to
give a more precise characterization of erasure robustness of frames. In the
paper the authors established that random frames whose entries are drawn
independently from the standard normal distribution can be robust against up to
approximately 15\% erasures, and asked whether there exist frames that are
robust against erasures of more than 50\%. In this paper we show that with very
high probability random frames are, independent of the dimension, robust
against any amount of erasures as long as the number of remaining vectors is at
least $1+\delta$ times the dimension for some $\delta_0>0$. This is the best
possible result, and it also implies that the proportion of erasures can
arbitrarily close to 1 while still maintaining robustness. Our result depends
crucially on a new estimate for the smallest singular value of a rectangular
random matrix with independent standard normal entries.";Yang Wang;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.5969v1;cs.IT;;nerf
1210.0139v1;http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0139v1;2012-09-29;Group-theoretic constructions of erasure-robust frames;"In the field of compressed sensing, a key problem remains open: to explicitly
construct matrices with the restricted isometry property (RIP) whose
performance rivals those generated using random matrix theory. In short, RIP
involves estimating the singular values of a combinatorially large number of
submatrices, seemingly requiring an enormous amount of computation in even
low-dimensional examples. In this paper, we consider a similar problem
involving submatrix singular value estimation, namely the problem of explicitly
constructing numerically erasure robust frames (NERFs). Such frames are the
latest invention in a long line of research concerning the design of linear
encoders that are robust against data loss. We begin by focusing on a subtle
difference between the definition of a NERF and that of an RIP matrix, one that
allows us to introduce a new computational trick for quickly estimating NERF
bounds. In short, we estimate these bounds by evaluating the frame analysis
operator at every point of an epsilon-net for the unit sphere. We then borrow
ideas from the theory of group frames to construct explicit frames and
epsilon-nets with such high degrees of symmetry that the requisite number of
operator evaluations is greatly reduced. We conclude with numerical results,
using these new ideas to quickly produce decent estimates of NERF bounds which
would otherwise take an eternity. Though the more important RIP problem remains
open, this work nevertheless demonstrates the feasibility of exploiting
symmetry to greatly reduce the computational burden of similar combinatorial
linear algebra problems.";Matthew Fickus<author:sep>John Jasper<author:sep>Dustin G. Mixon<author:sep>Jesse Peterson;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.0139v1;math.FA;;nerf
