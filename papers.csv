applications such as robotics, engineering, graphics, and design. To better
capture complex real dynamics such as contact and friction, learned simulators
based on graph networks have recently shown great promise. However, applying
these learned simulators to real scenes comes with two major challenges: first,
scaling learned simulators to handle the complexity of real world scenes which
can involve hundreds of objects each with complicated 3D shapes, and second,
handling inputs from perception rather than 3D state information. Here we
introduce a method which substantially reduces the memory required to run
graph-based learned simulators. Based on this memory-efficient simulation
model, we then present a perceptual interface in the form of editable NeRFs
which can convert real-world scenes into a structured representation that can
be processed by graph network simulator. We show that our method uses
substantially less memory than previous graph-based simulators while retaining
their accuracy, and that the simulators learned in synthetic environments can
be applied to real world scenes captured from multiple camera angles. This
paves the way for expanding the application of learned simulators to settings
where only perceptual information is available at inference time.";Tatiana Lopez-Guevara<author:sep>Yulia Rubanova<author:sep>William F. Whitney<author:sep>Tobias Pfaff<author:sep>Kimberly Stachenfeld<author:sep>Kelsey R. Allen;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11985v1;cs.LG;16 pages, 12 figures;nerf

paradigm for novel view synthesis by learning scene representations from
discrete observations. Nevertheless, NeRF exhibit pronounced performance
degradation when confronted with sparse view inputs, consequently curtailing
its further applicability. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Geometric,
Semantic, and Photometric Guided NeRF (HG3-NeRF), a novel methodology that can
address the aforementioned limitation and enhance consistency of geometry,
semantic content, and appearance across different views. We propose
Hierarchical Geometric Guidance (HGG) to incorporate the attachment of
Structure from Motion (SfM), namely sparse depth prior, into the scene
representations. Different from direct depth supervision, HGG samples volume
points from local-to-global geometric regions, mitigating the misalignment
caused by inherent bias in the depth prior. Furthermore, we draw inspiration
from notable variations in semantic consistency observed across images of
different resolutions and propose Hierarchical Semantic Guidance (HSG) to learn
the coarse-to-fine semantic content, which corresponds to the coarse-to-fine
scene representations. Experimental results demonstrate that HG3-NeRF can
outperform other state-of-the-art methods on different standard benchmarks and
achieve high-fidelity synthesis results for sparse view inputs.";Zelin Gao<author:sep>Weichen Dai<author:sep>Yu Zhang;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11711v1;cs.CV;13 pages, 6 figures;nerf

with recent works adopting variants of dynamic radiance fields to achieve
success in 3D reconstruction of deformable tissues from single-viewpoint

Gaussian Splatting, a recent trending 3D representation, we present EndoGS,
applying Gaussian Splatting for deformable endoscopic tissue reconstruction.
Specifically, our approach incorporates deformation fields to handle dynamic

viewpoint, and a spatial-temporal weight mask to mitigate tool occlusion. As a
result, EndoGS reconstructs and renders high-quality deformable endoscopic

GaussianBody, based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Compared with the costly neural
radiance based models, 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently demonstrated great
performance in terms of training time and rendering quality. However, applying
the static 3D Gaussian Splatting model to the dynamic human reconstruction
problem is non-trivial due to complicated non-rigid deformations and rich cloth
details. To address these challenges, our method considers explicit pose-guided
deformation to associate dynamic Gaussians across the canonical space and the
observation space, introducing a physically-based prior with regularized
transformations helps mitigate ambiguity between the two spaces. During the
training process, we further propose a pose refinement strategy to update the
pose regression for compensating the inaccurate initial estimation and a
split-with-scale mechanism to enhance the density of regressed point clouds.
The experiments validate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art

accurate camera pose for each input view, typically obtained by
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines. Recent works have attempted to relax
this constraint, but they still often rely on decent initial poses which they
can refine. Here we aim at removing the requirement for pose initialization. We
present Incremental CONfidence (ICON), an optimization procedure for training
NeRFs from 2D video frames. ICON only assumes smooth camera motion to estimate
initial guess for poses. Further, ICON introduces ``confidence"": an adaptive
measure of model quality used to dynamically reweight gradients. ICON relies on
high-confidence poses to learn NeRF, and high-confidence 3D structure (as
encoded by NeRF) to learn poses. We show that ICON, without prior pose

challenging due to the lack of 4D labeled data. Existing methods extend
text-to-3D pipelines by transferring off-the-shelf image generation models such
as score distillation sampling, but they are slow and expensive to scale (e.g.,
150 minutes per object) due to the need for back-propagating the

address this limitation, we propose an efficient video-to-4D object generation
framework called Efficient4D. It generates high-quality spacetime-consistent
images under different camera views, and then uses them as labeled data to
directly train a novel 4D Gaussian splatting model with explicit point cloud
geometry, enabling real-time rendering under continuous camera trajectories.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real videos show that Efficient4D offers

applications. However, they face challenges in the sparse view setting, lacking
sufficient constraints from volume rendering. Reconstructing and understanding
a 3D scene from sparse and unconstrained cameras is a long-standing problem in
classical computer vision with diverse applications. While recent works have
explored NeRFs in sparse, unconstrained view scenarios, their focus has been
primarily on enhancing reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Our approach
takes a broader perspective by posing the question: ""from where has each point
been seen?"" -- which gates how well we can understand and reconstruct it. In
other words, we aim to determine the origin or provenance of each 3D point and
its associated information under sparse, unconstrained views. We introduce
ProvNeRF, a model that enriches a traditional NeRF representation by
incorporating per-point provenance, modeling likely source locations for each
point. We achieve this by extending implicit maximum likelihood estimation
(IMLE) for stochastic processes. Notably, our method is compatible with any
pre-trained NeRF model and the associated training camera poses. We demonstrate
that modeling per-point provenance offers several advantages, including
uncertainty estimation, criteria-based view selection, and improved novel view

method for compact 3D-consistent scene segmentation at fast rendering speed
with only RGB images input. Previous NeRF-based 3D segmentation methods have
relied on implicit or voxel neural scene representation and ray-marching volume
rendering which are time consuming. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting significantly
improves the rendering speed, however, existing Gaussians-based segmentation
methods(eg: Gaussian Grouping) fail to provide compact segmentation masks
especially in zero-shot segmentation, which is mainly caused by the lack of
robustness and compactness for straightforwardly assigning learnable parameters
to each Gaussian when encountering inconsistent 2D machine-generated labels.
Our method aims to achieve compact and reliable zero-shot scene segmentation
swiftly by mapping fused spatial and semantically meaningful features for each
Gaussian point with a shallow decoding network. Specifically, our method
firstly optimizes Gaussian points' position, convariance and color attributes
under the supervision of RGB images. After Gaussian Locating, we distill
multi-scale DINO features extracted from images through unprojection to each
Gaussian, which is then incorporated with spatial features from the fast point
features processing network, i.e. RandLA-Net. Then the shallow decoding MLP is
applied to the multi-scale fused features to obtain compact segmentation.
Experimental results show that our model can perform high-quality zero-shot
scene segmentation, as our model outperforms other segmentation methods on both

It supports dynamic motion and is tailored for shadow computation, thereby
avoiding the affine projection approximation and sorting required by the

minimal overhead. We demonstrate improved reconstructions, with better
separation of albedo, shading, and shadows in challenging outdoor scenes with
direct sun light and hard shadows. Our method is able to optimize the light

Importantly, our render pipeline is entirely differentiable, allowing for
automatic optimization of both point sizes and positions.

3D representations have been studied to generate 3D objects from a single
image. Due to its superior rendering efficiency, 3D Gaussian splatting-based
models have recently excelled in both 3D reconstruction and generation. 3D
Gaussian splatting approaches for image to 3D generation are often
optimization-based, requiring many computationally expensive score-distillation
steps. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an Amortized Generative 3D
Gaussian framework (AGG) that instantly produces 3D Gaussians from a single
image, eliminating the need for per-instance optimization. Utilizing an
intermediate hybrid representation, AGG decomposes the generation of 3D
Gaussian locations and other appearance attributes for joint optimization.
Moreover, we propose a cascaded pipeline that first generates a coarse
representation of the 3D data and later upsamples it with a 3D Gaussian
super-resolution module. Our method is evaluated against existing
optimization-based 3D Gaussian frameworks and sampling-based pipelines
utilizing other 3D representations, where AGG showcases competitive generation
abilities both qualitatively and quantitatively while being several orders of

technique in the explicit radiance field and computer graphics landscape. This
innovative approach, characterized by the utilization of millions of 3D
Gaussians, represents a significant departure from the neural radiance field

to map spatial coordinates to pixel values. 3D GS, with its explicit scene
representations and differentiable rendering algorithms, not only promises
real-time rendering capabilities but also introduces unprecedented levels of
control and editability. This positions 3D GS as a potential game-changer for
the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation. In the present

critical contributions in the domain of 3D GS. We begin with a detailed
exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the
advent of 3D GS, setting the stage for understanding its significance. A focal
point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS. By
facilitating real-time performance, 3D GS opens up a plethora of applications,
ranging from virtual reality to interactive media and beyond. This is
complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated
across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical

for efficient computation while alleviating noise patterns by reducing the

urban street is represented as a set of point clouds equipped with semantic

and per-scene training, which limits their real-life applications. Moreover,
current methods focus on single-subject cases, leaving scenes of interacting
hands that involve severe inter-hand occlusions and challenging view variations

given an image of interacting hands as input, our VA-NeRF first obtains a

visibility of query points and mesh vertices is introduced to adaptively merge
features of both hands, enabling the recovery of features in unseen areas.
Additionally, our VA-NeRF is optimized together with a novel discriminator
within an adversarial learning paradigm. In contrast to conventional
discriminators that predict a single real/fake label for the synthesized image,
the proposed discriminator generates a pixel-wise visibility map, providing
fine-grained supervision for unseen areas and encouraging the VA-NeRF to

synthesis with their photorealistic rendering quality. Nevertheless, they
usually employ neural networks and volumetric rendering, which are costly to
train and impede their broad use in various real-time applications due to the
lengthy rendering time. Lately 3D Gaussians splatting-based approach has been
proposed to model the 3D scene, and it achieves remarkable visual quality while
rendering the images in real-time. However, it suffers from severe degradation
in the rendering quality if the training images are blurry. Blurriness commonly
occurs due to the lens defocusing, object motion, and camera shake, and it
inevitably intervenes in clean image acquisition. Several previous studies have
attempted to render clean and sharp images from blurry input images using
neural fields. The majority of those works, however, are designed only for
volumetric rendering-based neural radiance fields and are not straightforwardly

a 3D scene. Modeling a 3D language field to support open-ended language queries
in 3D has gained increasing attention recently. This paper introduces
LangSplat, which constructs a 3D language field that enables precise and
efficient open-vocabulary querying within 3D spaces. Unlike existing methods
that ground CLIP language embeddings in a NeRF model, LangSplat advances the
field by utilizing a collection of 3D Gaussians, each encoding language
features distilled from CLIP, to represent the language field. By employing a
tile-based splatting technique for rendering language features, we circumvent
the costly rendering process inherent in NeRF. Instead of directly learning
CLIP embeddings, LangSplat first trains a scene-wise language autoencoder and
then learns language features on the scene-specific latent space, thereby
alleviating substantial memory demands imposed by explicit modeling. Existing
methods struggle with imprecise and vague 3D language fields, which fail to
discern clear boundaries between objects. We delve into this issue and propose
to learn hierarchical semantics using SAM, thereby eliminating the need for
extensively querying the language field across various scales and the

properties is often expensive both in terms of memory and computation. If we do
path tracing and use a high dynamic range lighting environment, the rendering
becomes computationally heavy. We propose a compact and efficient neural method
for representing and rendering the appearance of heterogeneous translucent
objects. The neural representation function resembles a bidirectional
scattering-surface reflectance distribution function (BSSRDF). However,
conventional BSSRDF models assume a planar half-space medium and only surface
variation of the material, which is often not a good representation of the
appearance of real-world objects. Our method represents the BSSRDF of a full
object taking its geometry and heterogeneities into account. This is similar to
a neural radiance field, but our representation works for an arbitrary distant
lighting environment. In a sense, we present a version of neural precomputed
radiance transfer that captures all-frequency relighting of heterogeneous
translucent objects. We use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with skip
connections to represent the appearance of an object as a function of spatial
position, direction of observation, and direction of incidence. The latter is
considered a directional light incident across the entire non-self-shadowed
part of the object. We demonstrate the ability of our method to store highly
complex materials while having high accuracy when comparing to reference images
of the represented object in unseen lighting environments. As compared with
path tracing of a heterogeneous light scattering volume behind a refractive

first, coarse localization using the proposed pose diffusion process, followed

pose estimators trained on public datasets significantly underperform when
applied to unseen out-of-distribution samples. Previous works proposed
augmenting public datasets by generating 2D-3D pose pairs or rendering a large
amount of random data. Such approaches either overlook image rendering or
result in suboptimal datasets for pre-trained models. Here we propose PoseGen,
which learns to generate a dataset (human 3D poses and images) with a feedback
loss from a given pre-trained pose estimator. In contrast to prior art, our

The objective of PoseGen is to learn a distribution of data that maximizes the

training longer with SFT improves consistency, it also causes distribution
shift, which reduces diversity and realistic details. We argue that the SFT of
multi-view diffusion models resembles the instruction finetuning stage of the
LLM alignment pipeline and can benefit from RL finetuning (RLFT) methods.
Essentially, RLFT methods optimize models beyond their SFT data distribution by
using their own outputs, effectively mitigating distribution shift. To this
end, we introduce Carve3D, a RLFT method coupled with the Multi-view
Reconstruction Consistency (MRC) metric, to improve the consistency of
multi-view diffusion models. To compute MRC on a set of multi-view images, we
compare them with their corresponding renderings of the reconstructed NeRF at

applications like content creation in movies, games and engineering, as well as
in AR/VR. Recently, diffusion models have shown remarkable results in
generation quality of 3D objects. However, none of the existing models enable
disentangled generation to control the shape and appearance separately. For the
first time, we present a suitable representation for 3D diffusion models to
enable such disentanglement by introducing a hybrid point cloud and neural
radiance field approach. We model a diffusion process over point positions
jointly with a high-dimensional feature space for a local density and radiance
decoder. While the point positions represent the coarse shape of the object,
the point features allow modeling the geometry and appearance details. This
disentanglement enables us to sample both independently and therefore to
control both separately. Our approach sets a new state of the art in generation

Neural radiance fields, particularly NeRF, initially developed for static
scenes, have spurred the creation of various methods for video view synthesis.
However, the challenge for video view synthesis arises from motion blur, a
consequence of object or camera movement during exposure, which hinders the
precise synthesis of sharp spatio-temporal views. In response, we propose a
novel dynamic deblurring NeRF framework for blurry monocular video, called
DyBluRF, consisting of an Interleave Ray Refinement (IRR) stage and a Motion

addresses and handles the novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video. The
IRR stage jointly reconstructs dynamic 3D scenes and refines the inaccurate
camera pose information to combat imprecise pose information extracted from the
given blurry frames. The MDD stage is a novel incremental latent sharp-rays

the latent sharp rays into global camera motion and local object motion

novel view images of a 3D scene. It includes density and color fields to model
the shape and radiance of a scene, respectively. Supervised by the photometric
loss in an end-to-end training manner, NeRF inherently suffers from the
shape-radiance ambiguity problem, i.e., it can perfectly fit training views but
does not guarantee decoupling the two fields correctly. To deal with this
issue, existing works have incorporated prior knowledge to provide an
independent supervision signal for the density field, including total variation
loss, sparsity loss, distortion loss, etc. These losses are based on general
assumptions about the density field, e.g., it should be smooth, sparse, or
compact, which are not adaptive to a specific scene. In this paper, we propose
a more adaptive method to reduce the shape-radiance ambiguity. The key is a
rendering method that is only based on the density field. Specifically, we
first estimate the color field based on the density field and posed images in a
closed form. Then NeRF's rendering process can proceed. We address the problems
in estimating the color field, including occlusion and non-uniformly
distributed views. Afterward, it is applied to regularize NeRF's density field.
As our regularization is guided by photometric loss, it is more adaptive
compared to existing ones. Experimental results show that our method improves
the density field of NeRF both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our code is

of producing evermore photo-realistic results. 3D Gaussian Splatting has
emerged as a particularly promising method, producing high-quality renderings
of static scenes and enabling interactive viewing at real-time frame rates.
However, it is currently limited to static scenes only. In this work, we extend
3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct dynamic scenes. We model the dynamics of a
scene using a tunable MLP, which learns the deformation field from a canonical
space to a set of 3D Gaussians per frame. To disentangle the static and dynamic
parts of the scene, we learn a tuneable parameter for each Gaussian, which
weighs the respective MLP parameters to focus attention on the dynamic parts.
This improves the model's ability to capture dynamics in scenes with an
imbalance of static to dynamic regions. To handle scenes of arbitrary length
whilst maintaining high rendering quality, we introduce an adaptive window
sampling strategy to partition the sequence into windows based on the amount of
movement in the sequence. We train a separate dynamic Gaussian Splatting model
for each window, allowing the canonical representation to change, thus enabling
the reconstruction of scenes with significant geometric or topological changes.
Temporal consistency is enforced using a fine-tuning step with self-supervising
consistency loss on randomly sampled novel views. As a result, our method
produces high-quality renderings of general dynamic scenes with competitive
quantitative performance, which can be viewed in real-time with our dynamic

for modeling of static 3D scenes. In contrast to Neural Radiance Fields, it
utilizes efficient rasterization allowing for very fast rendering at
high-quality. However, the storage size is significantly higher, which hinders
practical deployment, e.g.~on resource constrained devices. In this paper, we
introduce a compact scene representation organizing the parameters of 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into a 2D grid with local homogeneity, ensuring a
drastic reduction in storage requirements without compromising visual quality
during rendering. Central to our idea is the explicit exploitation of
perceptual redundancies present in natural scenes. In essence, the inherent
nature of a scene allows for numerous permutations of Gaussian parameters to
equivalently represent it. To this end, we propose a novel highly parallel
algorithm that regularly arranges the high-dimensional Gaussian parameters into
a 2D grid while preserving their neighborhood structure. During training, we
further enforce local smoothness between the sorted parameters in the grid. The
uncompressed Gaussians use the same structure as 3DGS, ensuring a seamless
integration with established renderers. Our method achieves a reduction factor
of 8x to 26x in size for complex scenes with no increase in training time,
marking a substantial leap forward in the domain of 3D scene distribution and
consumption. Additional information can be found on our project page:

This framework aims to guide the NeRF model to synthesize high-resolution novel

high-resolution training data. Our approach consists of two stages. First, we
learn a scene-specific degradation mapping by performing internal learning on a
pretrained low-resolution coarse NeRF. Second, we optimize a super-resolution
fine NeRF by conducting inverse rendering with our mapping function so as to
backpropagate the gradients from low-resolution 2D space into the
super-resolution 3D sampling space. Then, we further introduce a temporal
ensemble strategy in the inference phase to compensate for the scene estimation
errors. Our method is featured on two points: (1) it does not consume
high-resolution views or additional scene data to train super-resolution NeRF;
(2) it can speed up the training process by adopting a coarse-to-fine strategy.

generate realistic portraits of a new speaker with fewshot dataset.
Specifically, we introduce an Audio Aware Aggregation module into the feature

In this paper, we seek to leverage Gaussian splatting to generate realistic

flexibility and efficiency) imposed by mesh or NeRF-based representations.
However, a naive application of Gaussian splatting cannot generate high-quality
animatable avatars and suffers from learning instability; it also cannot
capture fine avatar geometries and often leads to degenerate body parts. To
tackle these problems, we first propose a primitive-based 3D Gaussian
representation where Gaussians are defined inside pose-driven primitives to
facilitate animation. Second, to stabilize and amortize the learning of
millions of Gaussians, we propose to use neural implicit fields to predict the
Gaussian attributes (e.g., colors). Finally, to capture fine avatar geometries

correspondence between various face representations for motion transfer. Recent
studies have utilized Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) as fundamental
representation, which further enhanced the performance of multi-view face
reenactment in photo-realism and 3D consistency. However, establishing dense
correspondence between different face NeRFs is non-trivial, because implicit
representations lack ground-truth correspondence annotations like mesh-based 3D
parametric models (e.g., 3DMM) with index-aligned vertexes. Although aligning
3DMM space with NeRF-based face representations can realize motion control, it
is sub-optimal for their limited face-only modeling and low identity fidelity.
Therefore, we are inspired to ask: Can we learn the dense correspondence
between different NeRF-based face representations without a 3D parametric model
prior? To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, which adopts
tri-planes as fundamental NeRF representation and decomposes face tri-planes
into three components: canonical tri-planes, identity deformations, and motion.
In terms of motion control, our key contribution is proposing a Plane
Dictionary (PlaneDict) module, which efficiently maps the motion conditions to
a linear weighted addition of learnable orthogonal plane bases. To the best of
our knowledge, our framework is the first method that achieves one-shot

of three functional components: mode-disengaging, mode-seeking and
variance-reducing terms, and analyze the properties of each. We show that
problems such as over-smoothness and color-saturation result from the intrinsic

by the evolution of generative models. Prominent among these are methods based
on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and the adaptation of diffusion models in
the 3D domain. Despite their progress, these techniques often face limitations
due to slow optimization or rendering processes, leading to extensive training
and optimization times. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for
single-view reconstruction that efficiently generates a 3D model from a single
image via feed-forward inference. Our method utilizes two transformer-based
networks, namely a point decoder and a triplane decoder, to reconstruct 3D
objects using a hybrid Triplane-Gaussian intermediate representation. This
hybrid representation strikes a balance, achieving a faster rendering speed
compared to implicit representations while simultaneously delivering superior
rendering quality than explicit representations. The point decoder is designed
for generating point clouds from single images, offering an explicit
representation which is then utilized by the triplane decoder to query Gaussian
features for each point. This design choice addresses the challenges associated
with directly regressing explicit 3D Gaussian attributes characterized by their
non-structural nature. Subsequently, the 3D Gaussians are decoded by an MLP to
enable rapid rendering through splatting. Both decoders are built upon a
scalable, transformer-based architecture and have been efficiently trained on
large-scale 3D datasets. The evaluations conducted on both synthetic datasets
and real-world images demonstrate that our method not only achieves higher
quality but also ensures a faster runtime in comparison to previous

target view given source view images and their corresponding poses, is a
fundamental problem in 3D Vision. As this task is heavily under-constrained,
some recent work, like Zero123, tries to solve this problem with generative
modeling, specifically using pre-trained diffusion models. Although this
strategy generalizes well to new scenes, compared to neural radiance
field-based methods, it offers low levels of flexibility. For example, it can
only accept a single-view image as input, despite realistic applications often
offering multiple input images. This is because the source-view images and
corresponding poses are processed separately and injected into the model at
different stages. Thus it is not trivial to generalize the model into
multi-view source images, once they are available. To solve this issue, we try
to process each pose image pair separately and then fuse them as a unified
visual representation which will be injected into the model to guide image
synthesis at the target-views. However, inconsistency and computation costs
increase as the number of input source-view images increases. To solve these

variable-length input data to fix-size output data. A two-stage training

correspondences in images and 3D correspondences on object surfaces. Is there
another kind, and if there is, what can they do for us? In this paper, we
introduce correspondences of the third kind we call reflection correspondences

without relying on the background. Reflection correspondences are point
correspondences in the reflected world, i.e., the scene reflected by the object
surface. The object geometry and reflectance alters the scene geometrically and
radiometrically, respectively, causing incorrect pixel correspondences.
Geometry recovered from each image is also hampered by distortions, namely
generalized bas-relief ambiguity, leading to erroneous 3D correspondences. We
show that reflection correspondences can resolve the ambiguities arising from
these distortions. We introduce a neural correspondence estimator and a RANSAC
algorithm that fully leverages all three kinds of correspondences for robust
and accurate joint camera pose and object shape estimation just from the object
appearance. The method expands the horizon of numerous downstream tasks,

distillation from 2D foundation models. However, these methods have two major
limitations: (a) they are limited by the rendering speed of NeRF pipelines, and
(b) implicitly represented feature fields suffer from continuity artifacts

state-of-the-art performance on real-time radiance field rendering. In this

on large-scale synthetic and real-captured object data like Objaverse and
MVImgNet, a similar level of progress has not been observed in the domain of
human-centric tasks partially due to the lack of a large-scale human dataset.
Existing datasets of high-fidelity 3D human capture continue to be mid-sized
due to the significant challenges in acquiring large-scale high-quality 3D
human data. To bridge this gap, we present MVHumanNet, a dataset that comprises
multi-view human action sequences of 4,500 human identities. The primary focus
of our work is on collecting human data that features a large number of diverse
identities and everyday clothing using a multi-view human capture system, which
facilitates easily scalable data collection. Our dataset contains 9,000 daily
outfits, 60,000 motion sequences and 645 million frames with extensive
annotations, including human masks, camera parameters, 2D and 3D keypoints,
SMPL/SMPLX parameters, and corresponding textual descriptions. To explore the
potential of MVHumanNet in various 2D and 3D visual tasks, we conducted pilot
studies on view-consistent action recognition, human NeRF reconstruction,
text-driven view-unconstrained human image generation, as well as 2D
view-unconstrained human image and 3D avatar generation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the performance improvements and effective applications enabled by
the scale provided by MVHumanNet. As the current largest-scale 3D human
dataset, we hope that the release of MVHumanNet data with annotations will
foster further innovations in the domain of 3D human-centric tasks at scale.";Zhangyang Xiong<author:sep>Chenghong Li<author:sep>Kenkun Liu<author:sep>Hongjie Liao<author:sep>Jianqiao Hu<author:sep>Junyi Zhu<author:sep>Shuliang Ning<author:sep>Lingteng Qiu<author:sep>Chongjie Wang<author:sep>Shijie Wang<author:sep>Shuguang Cui<author:sep>Xiaoguang Han;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02963v1;cs.CV;Project page: https://x-zhangyang.github.io/MVHumanNet/;nerf

real-world objects can be modeled more efficiently with surfaces instead of
volumes, requiring far fewer samples per ray. This observation has spurred
considerable progress in surface representations such as signed distance
functions, but these may struggle to model semi-opaque and thin structures. We
propose a method, HybridNeRF, that leverages the strengths of both

predict the scene changes in that view, which has significant potential
applications in scene monitoring and measuring. We conducted preliminary
studies and found that such an exciting task cannot be easily achieved by
utilizing existing NeRFs and 2D change detection methods with many false or
missing detections. The main reason is that the 2D change detection is based on
the pixel appearance difference between spatial-aligned image pairs and
neglects the stereo information in the NeRF. To address the limitations, we
propose the C-NERF to represent scene changes as directional consistency
difference-based NeRF, which mainly contains three modules. We first perform
the spatial alignment of two NeRFs captured before and after changes. Then, we
identify the change points based on the direction-consistent constraint; that
is, real change points have similar change representations across view
directions, but fake change points do not. Finally, we design the change map
rendering process based on the built NeRFs and can generate the change map of

to visualize the internal anatomical structures of patients. During a CBCT
scan, several projection images of different angles or views are collectively
utilized to reconstruct a tomographic image. However, reducing the number of
projections in a CBCT scan while preserving the quality of a reconstructed

Recently, a neural attenuation field (NAF) method was proposed by adopting a
neural radiance field algorithm as a new way for CBCT reconstruction,
demonstrating fast and promising results using only 50 views. However,
decreasing the number of projections is still preferable to reduce potential
radiation exposure, and a faster reconstruction time is required considering a
typical scan time. In this work, we propose a fast and accurate sparse-view

faster optimization speed in the minimal number of view acquisitions ($<$ 50

computer vision and graphics. Recently, Gaussian splatting has emerged as a
robust technique to represent static scenes and enable high-quality and
real-time novel view synthesis. Building upon this technique, we propose a new
representation that explicitly decomposes the motion and appearance of dynamic
scenes into sparse control points and dense Gaussians, respectively. Our key
idea is to use sparse control points, significantly fewer in number than the
Gaussians, to learn compact 6 DoF transformation bases, which can be locally
interpolated through learned interpolation weights to yield the motion field of
3D Gaussians. We employ a deformation MLP to predict time-varying 6 DoF
transformations for each control point, which reduces learning complexities,
enhances learning abilities, and facilitates obtaining temporal and spatial
coherent motion patterns. Then, we jointly learn the 3D Gaussians, the
canonical space locations of control points, and the deformation MLP to
reconstruct the appearance, geometry, and dynamics of 3D scenes. During
learning, the location and number of control points are adaptively adjusted to
accommodate varying motion complexities in different regions, and an ARAP loss
following the principle of as rigid as possible is developed to enforce spatial
continuity and local rigidity of learned motions. Finally, thanks to the
explicit sparse motion representation and its decomposition from appearance,
our method can enable user-controlled motion editing while retaining
high-fidelity appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing approaches on novel view synthesis with a high rendering

However, accurate long-sequence colonoscopy reconstruction faces three major
challenges: (1) dissimilarity among segments of the colon due to its meandering

geometry structures; (3) sparse viewpoints due to constrained camera
trajectories. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new reconstruction
framework based on neural radiance field (NeRF), named ColonNeRF, which
leverages neural rendering for novel view synthesis of long-sequence
colonoscopy. Specifically, to reconstruct the entire colon in a piecewise
manner, our ColonNeRF introduces a region division and integration module,
effectively reducing shape dissimilarity and ensuring geometric consistency in
each segment. To learn both the simple and complex geometry in a unified
framework, our ColonNeRF incorporates a multi-level fusion module that
progressively models the colon regions from easy to hard. Additionally, to
overcome the challenges from sparse views, we devise a DensiNet module for
densifying camera poses under the guidance of semantic consistency. We conduct
extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate our
ColonNeRF. Quantitatively, our ColonNeRF outperforms existing methods on two

capabilities of zero-shot segmentation, while NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) has
gained popularity as a method for various 3D problems beyond novel view
synthesis. Though there exist initial attempts to incorporate these two methods
into 3D segmentation, they face the challenge of accurately and consistently
segmenting objects in complex scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the
Segment Anything for NeRF in High Quality (SANeRF-HQ) to achieve high quality
3D segmentation of any object in a given scene. SANeRF-HQ utilizes SAM for
open-world object segmentation guided by user-supplied prompts, while
leveraging NeRF to aggregate information from different viewpoints. To overcome
the aforementioned challenges, we employ density field and RGB similarity to
enhance the accuracy of segmentation boundary during the aggregation.
Emphasizing on segmentation accuracy, we evaluate our method quantitatively on
multiple NeRF datasets where high-quality ground-truths are available or
manually annotated. SANeRF-HQ shows a significant quality improvement over
previous state-of-the-art methods in NeRF object segmentation, provides higher
flexibility for object localization, and enables more consistent object

overcome this limitation, recent works have focused on training NeRF only with
sparse viewpoints by giving additional regularizations, often called few-shot
NeRF. We observe that due to the under-constrained nature of the task, solely
using additional regularization is not enough to prevent the model from
overfitting to sparse viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
dubbed Self-Evolving Neural Radiance Fields (SE-NeRF), that applies a
self-training framework to NeRF to address these problems. We formulate
few-shot NeRF into a teacher-student framework to guide the network to learn a
more robust representation of the scene by training the student with additional
pseudo labels generated from the teacher. By distilling ray-level pseudo labels
using distinct distillation schemes for reliable and unreliable rays obtained
with our novel reliability estimation method, we enable NeRF to learn a more

nature of the SDS loss. Our analysis identifies the core of these challenges as
the interaction among noise levels in the 2D diffusion process, the

overcome these limitations, we present StableDreamer, a methodology
incorporating three advances. First, inspired by InstructNeRF2NeRF, we
formalize the equivalence of the SDS generative prior and a simple supervised
L2 reconstruction loss. This finding provides a novel tool to debug SDS, which
we use to show the impact of time-annealing noise levels on reducing
multi-faced geometries. Second, our analysis shows that while image-space
diffusion contributes to geometric precision, latent-space diffusion is crucial
for vivid color rendition. Based on this observation, StableDreamer introduces
a two-stage training strategy that effectively combines these aspects,
resulting in high-fidelity 3D models. Third, we adopt an anisotropic 3D
Gaussians representation, replacing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), to enhance

polygons, which can then be used to obtain the quadrature points required to
model volumetric effects, and also their opacity and colour from the texture.
To obtain such polygonal mesh, we train a specialized field whose
zero-crossings would correspond to the quadrature points when volume rendering,

3D Gaussian Splatting) use a rasterization pipeline to enable rendering high

These methods have been demonstrated to be very promising, providing
state-of-art quality for many important tasks. However, training a model to
represent a scene is still a time-consuming task even when using powerful GPUs.
In this work, we observe that the gradient computation phase during training is
a significant bottleneck on GPUs due to the large number of atomic operations
that need to be processed. These atomic operations overwhelm atomic units in
the L2 partitions causing stalls. To address this challenge, we leverage the
observations that during the gradient computation: (1) for most warps, all
threads atomically update the same memory locations; and (2) warps generate
varying amounts of atomic traffic (since some threads may be inactive). We
propose DISTWAR, a software-approach to accelerate atomic operations based on
two key ideas: First, we enable warp-level reduction of threads at the SM
sub-cores using registers to leverage the locality in intra-warp atomic
updates. Second, we distribute the atomic computation between the warp-level
reduction at the SM and the L2 atomic units to increase the throughput of
atomic computation. Warps with many threads performing atomic updates to the
same memory locations are scheduled at the SM, and the rest using L2 atomic

that it can generate dense point clouds with detailed structure. Nonetheless, a
naive adoption of 3D Gaussian Splatting can fail since the generated points are
the centers of 3D Gaussians that do not necessarily lie on the surface. We thus
introduce a scale regularizer to pull the centers close to the surface by
enforcing the 3D Gaussians to be extremely thin. Moreover, we propose to refine
the point cloud from 3D Gaussians Splatting with the normal priors from the
surface predicted by neural implicit models instead of using a fixed set of
points as guidance. Consequently, the quality of surface reconstruction
improves from the guidance of the more accurate 3D Gaussian splatting. By

Our neural representation adequately constrains the inherently underconstrained

This is done by biding each point to motion coefficients that enforce the
per-point sharing of basis trajectories. By carefully applying a sparsity loss

can facilitate new applications in robotics, augmented reality, and generative
AI. However, tracking under these conditions is extremely challenging due to
the ambiguity that arises with large deformations, shadows, and occlusions. We
introduce MD-Splatting, an approach for simultaneous 3D tracking and novel view
synthesis, using video captures of a dynamic scene from various camera poses.
MD-Splatting builds on recent advances in Gaussian splatting, a method that
learns the properties of a large number of Gaussians for state-of-the-art and
fast novel view synthesis. MD-Splatting learns a deformation function to
project a set of Gaussians with non-metric, thus canonical, properties into
metric space. The deformation function uses a neural-voxel encoding and a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) to infer Gaussian position, rotation, and a shadow
scalar. We enforce physics-inspired regularization terms based on local
rigidity, conservation of momentum, and isometry, which leads to trajectories
with smaller trajectory errors. MD-Splatting achieves high-quality 3D tracking
on highly deformable scenes with shadows and occlusions. Compared to
state-of-the-art, we improve 3D tracking by an average of 23.9 %, while
simultaneously achieving high-quality novel view synthesis. With sufficient

LightGaussian employs distillation and pseudo-view augmentation to distill

scalable large-scale neural scene reconstruction. We structure the neural
representation as an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder processes
3D point coordinates to produce encoded features, and the decoder generates
geometric values that include volume densities of signed distances and colors.
Our approach first trains a coarse global model on the entire image dataset.
Subsequently, we partition the images into smaller blocks using KMeans with
each block being modeled by a dedicated local model. We enhance the overlapping
regions across different blocks by scaling up the bounding boxes of each local
block. Notably, the decoder from the global model is shared across distinct
blocks and therefore promoting alignment in the feature space of local
encoders. We propose an effective and efficient methodology to fuse the outputs
from these local models to attain the final reconstruction. Employing this
refined coarse-to-fine strategy, our method outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF

Existing methods for such scenes usually involve with spatial warping,

this paper presents a novel framework that learns a density space from the

volumetric rendering. Specifically, we make use of a differentiable renderer to
synthesize images from the neural density features obtained from the learned

challenging due to the presence of multiple reflection and refraction effects.
Thus, this paper proposes a NeRF-based modeling method for scenes containing a

Subsequently, a video diffusion model is employed to learn the motion specific

capabilities of diffusion models shown in pixel space to parameter space, we
reformulate the 2D image editing method into an optimization form named PDS.
PDS matches the stochastic latents of the source and the target, enabling the
sampling of targets in diverse parameter spaces that align with a desired

optimization resembles running a generative process with the target attribute,

capturing complex 3D scenes with high fidelity. However, one persistent
challenge that hinders the widespread adoption of NeRFs is the computational
bottleneck due to the volumetric rendering. On the other hand, 3D Gaussian
splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an alternative representation that
leverages a 3D Gaussisan-based representation and adopts the rasterization
pipeline to render the images rather than volumetric rendering, achieving very
fast rendering speed and promising image quality. However, a significant
drawback arises as 3DGS entails a substantial number of 3D Gaussians to
maintain the high fidelity of the rendered images, which requires a large
amount of memory and storage. To address this critical issue, we place a
specific emphasis on two key objectives: reducing the number of Gaussian points

Majority of the existing approaches work in 2D image domain and have 3D
inconsistency issue when applied on different viewpoints of the same face. In
this paper, we tackle the problem of 3D face style transfer which aims at
generating stylized novel views of a 3D human face with multi-view consistency.
We propose to use a neural radiance field (NeRF) to represent 3D human face and
combine it with 2D style transfer to stylize the 3D face. We find that directly
training a NeRF on stylized images from 2D style transfer brings in 3D
inconsistency issue and causes blurriness. On the other hand, training a NeRF
jointly with 2D style transfer objectives shows poor convergence due to the
identity and head pose gap between style image and content image. It also poses
challenge in training time and memory due to the need of volume rendering for
full image to apply style transfer loss functions. We therefore propose a
hybrid framework of NeRF and mesh rasterization to combine the benefits of high
fidelity geometry reconstruction of NeRF and fast rendering speed of mesh. Our
framework consists of three stages: 1. Training a NeRF model on input face

model and optimizing it with style transfer objectives via differentiable
rasterization; 3. Training a new color network in NeRF conditioned on a style

potential, has garnered significant attention in the AIGC domain. However, the
amalgamation of Nerf and 2D diffusion models frequently yields oversaturated

the constraints of pixelwise rendering method. Gaussian splatting has recently
superseded the traditional pointwise sampling technique prevalent in NeRF-based
methodologies, revolutionizing various aspects of 3D reconstruction. This paper
introduces a novel text to 3D content generation framework based on Gaussian
splatting, enabling fine control over image saturation through individual
Gaussian sphere transparencies, thereby producing more realistic images. The
challenge of achieving multi-view consistency in 3D generation significantly
impedes modeling complexity and accuracy. Taking inspiration from SJC, we
explore employing multi-view noise distributions to perturb images generated by
3D Gaussian splatting, aiming to rectify inconsistencies in multi-view
geometry. We ingeniously devise an efficient method to generate noise that
produces Gaussian noise from diverse viewpoints, all originating from a shared
noise source. Furthermore, vanilla 3D Gaussian-based generation tends to trap
models in local minima, causing artifacts like floaters, burrs, or
proliferative elements. To mitigate these issues, we propose the variational

essential to represent fuzzy geometry such as foliage and hair, and they are
well-suited for stochastic optimization. Yet, many scenes ultimately consist
largely of solid surfaces which can be accurately rendered by a single sample
per pixel. Based on this insight, we propose a neural radiance formulation that
smoothly transitions between volumetric- and surface-based rendering, greatly
accelerating rendering speed and even improving visual fidelity. Our method
constructs an explicit mesh envelope which spatially bounds a neural volumetric
representation. In solid regions, the envelope nearly converges to a surface
and can often be rendered with a single sample. To this end, we generalize the
NeuS formulation with a learned spatially-varying kernel size which encodes the
spread of the density, fitting a wide kernel to volume-like regions and a tight
kernel to surface-like regions. We then extract an explicit mesh of a narrow
band around the surface, with width determined by the kernel size, and
fine-tune the radiance field within this band. At inference time, we cast rays
against the mesh and evaluate the radiance field only within the enclosed

in computer vision. Given a set of images taken from a freely moving camera at
train time, the proposed approach could synthesize a realistic image of the
scene from a novel viewpoint at test time. The key ideas presented in this
paper are (i) Recovering accurate camera parameters via a robust pipeline from
unposed day-to-day images is equally crucial in neural novel view synthesis
problem; (ii) It is rather more practical to model object's content at
different resolutions since dramatic camera motion is highly likely in
day-to-day unposed images. To incorporate the key ideas, we leverage the
fundamentals of scene rigidity, multi-scale neural scene representation, and
single-image depth prediction. Concretely, the proposed approach makes the
camera parameters as learnable in a neural fields-based modeling framework. By
assuming per view depth prediction is given up to scale, we constrain the
relative pose between successive frames. From the relative poses, absolute
camera pose estimation is modeled via a graph-neural network-based multiple
motion averaging within the multi-scale neural-fields network, leading to a
single loss function. Optimizing the introduced loss function provides camera
intrinsic, extrinsic, and image rendering from unposed images. We demonstrate,
with examples, that for a unified framework to accurately model multiscale
neural scene representation from day-to-day acquired unposed multi-view images,
it is equally essential to have precise camera-pose estimates within the scene
representation framework. Without considering robustness measures in the camera
pose estimation pipeline, modeling for multi-scale aliasing artifacts can be
counterproductive. We present extensive experiments on several benchmark

representing and synthesizing detailed textures remains a challenge for
unbounded large-scale outdoor scenes. To alleviate the dilemma of using
individual points to perceive the entire colossal space, we explore learning
the surface distribution of the scene to provide structural priors and reduce

large-scale point cloud super-resolution diffusion module that enhances the
sparse point cloud reconstructed from several training images into a dense

points with prior points within the sampling radius are retained. That is, the
sampling space is reduced from the unbounded space to the scene surface.
Meanwhile, to fill in the background of the scene that cannot be provided by

achieve this task from only a few images by introducing a new loss function for
unknown viewpoints with no input images. The loss function assumes that a
pre-trained feature extractor should output the same feature even if input
images are captured at different viewpoints since the images contain the same

as viewpoints continuously change, also feature vectors continuously change.
Thus, the assumption can harm training. To avoid this harmful training, we
propose ManifoldNeRF, a method for supervising feature vectors at unknown

the method provides appropriate supervision for each unknown viewpoint by the
interpolated features, the volume representation is learned better than
DietNeRF. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs better

interpretation. In this work, we propose Dynamic Appearance Particle Neural
Radiance Field (DAP-NeRF), which introduces particle-based representation to
model the motions of visual elements in a dynamic 3D scene. DAP-NeRF consists
of superposition of a static field and a dynamic field. The dynamic field is
quantised as a collection of {\em appearance particles}, which carries the
visual information of a small dynamic element in the scene and is equipped with
a motion model. All components, including the static field, the visual features
and motion models of the particles, are learned from monocular videos without
any prior geometric knowledge of the scene. We develop an efficient
computational framework for the particle-based model. We also construct a new

planning a path to the next best view only. To address these limitations, we
propose a non-iterative pipeline based on the Prediction of the Required number
of Views (PRV). The key idea behind our approach is that the required number of
views to reconstruct an object depends on its complexity. Therefore, we design
a deep neural network, named PRVNet, to predict the required number of views,
allowing us to tailor the data acquisition based on the object complexity and
plan a globally shortest path. To train our PRVNet, we generate supervision
labels using the ShapeNet dataset. Simulated experiments show that our
PRV-based view planning method outperforms baselines, achieving good
reconstruction quality while significantly reducing movement cost and planning
time. We further justify the generalization ability of our approach in a

Specifically, we introduce a location-specific sampling technique as well as a
multi-camera tiling (MCT) strategy to reduce memory consumption during image
loading for RAM, representation training for GPU memory, and increase the
convergence rate within tiles. MCT decomposes a large-frame image into multiple
tiled images with different camera models, allowing these small-frame images to
be fed into the training process as needed for specific locations without a
loss of accuracy. We implement our method on a representative approach,
Mip-NeRF, and compare its geometry performance with threephotgrammetric MVS

on multi-plane images (MPI), for high-quality view synthesis of complex scenes.
MPI with Normalized Device Coordinate (NDC) parameterization is widely used in
NeRF learning for its simple definition, easy calculation, and powerful ability
to represent unbounded scenes. However, existing NeRF works that adopt MPI
representation for novel view synthesis can only handle simple forward-facing
unbounded scenes, where the input cameras are all observing in similar
directions with small relative translations. Hence, extending these MPI-based
methods to more complex scenes like large-range or even 360-degree scenes is
very challenging. In this paper, we explore the potential of MPI and show that
MPI can synthesize high-quality novel views of complex scenes with diverse
camera distributions and view directions, which are not only limited to simple
forward-facing scenes. Our key idea is to encode the neural radiance field with
multiple MPIs facing different directions and blend them with an adaptive
blending operation. For each region of the scene, the blending operation gives
larger blending weights to those advantaged MPIs with stronger local
representation abilities while giving lower weights to those with weaker
representation abilities. Such blending operation automatically modulates the
multiple MPIs to appropriately represent the diverse local density and color
information. Experiments on the KITTI dataset and ScanNet dataset demonstrate
that our proposed MMPI synthesizes high-quality images from diverse camera pose
distributions and is fast to train, outperforming the previous fast-training
NeRF methods for novel view synthesis. Moreover, we show that MMPI can encode
extremely long trajectories and produce novel view renderings, demonstrating
its potential in applications like autonomous driving.";Yuze He<author:sep>Peng Wang<author:sep>Yubin Hu<author:sep>Wang Zhao<author:sep>Ran Yi<author:sep>Yong-Jin Liu<author:sep>Wenping Wang;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00249v1;cs.CV;;nerf

synthesis of dynamic scenes using forward warping. Existing methods often adopt
a static NeRF to represent the canonical space, and render dynamic images at
other time steps by mapping the sampled 3D points back to the canonical space
with the learned backward flow field. However, this backward flow field is
non-smooth and discontinuous, which is difficult to be fitted by commonly used
smooth motion models. To address this problem, we propose to estimate the
forward flow field and directly warp the canonical radiance field to other time
steps. Such forward flow field is smooth and continuous within the object
region, which benefits the motion model learning. To achieve this goal, we
represent the canonical radiance field with voxel grids to enable efficient
forward warping, and propose a differentiable warping process, including an
average splatting operation and an inpaint network, to resolve the many-to-one
and one-to-many mapping issues. Thorough experiments show that our method
outperforms existing methods in both novel view rendering and motion modeling,

Image (MPI) estimates the scene as a stack of RGBA layers, and can model
complex appearance effects, anti-alias depth errors and synthesize soft edges
better than methods that use textured meshes or layered depth images. And
unlike neural radiance fields, an MPI can be efficiently rendered on graphics
hardware. However, MPIs are highly redundant and require a large number of
depth layers to achieve plausible results. Based on the observation that the
depth complexity in local image regions is lower than that over the entire
image, we split an MPI into many small, tiled regions, each with only a few
depth planes. We call this representation a Tiled Multiplane Image (TMPI). We
propose a method for generating a TMPI with adaptive depth planes for
single-view 3D photography in the wild. Our synthesized results are comparable
to state-of-the-art single-view MPI methods while having lower computational

styles, which requires high-quality generating and keeping multi-view
consistency. Existing methods still suffer the challenges of high-quality
stylization with texture details and stylization with multimodal guidance. In
this paper, we reveal that the common training method of stylization with NeRF,
which generates stylized multi-view supervision by 2D style transfer models,
causes the same object in supervision to show various states (color tone,
details, etc.) in different views, leading NeRF to tend to smooth the texture
details, further resulting in low-quality rendering for 3D multi-style
transfer. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Multimodal-guided 3D
Multi-style transfer of NeRF, termed MM-NeRF. First, MM-NeRF projects
multimodal guidance into a unified space to keep the multimodal styles
consistency and extracts multimodal features to guide the 3D stylization.
Second, a novel multi-head learning scheme is proposed to relieve the
difficulty of learning multi-style transfer, and a multi-view style consistent
loss is proposed to track the inconsistency of multi-view supervision data.
Finally, a novel incremental learning mechanism to generalize MM-NeRF to any
new style with small costs. Extensive experiments on several real-world

performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we design a real-time
tightly-coupled Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-aided visual-inertial navigation

synthesize novel views, essential for addressing limited viewpoints, the
proposed NeRF-VINS optimally fuses IMU and monocular image measurements along

This tightly coupled integration enables 3D motion tracking with bounded error.
We extensively compare the proposed NeRF-VINS against the state-of-the-art

due to the coexistence of flat and texture-less regions alongside delicate and

predicted surface normal priors to recover the scene geometry. These methods
excel in producing complete and smooth results for floor and wall areas.
However, they struggle to capture complex surfaces with high-frequency

Contrary to other NeRF-based methods which enhance existing grasp pose

recent interest, existing methods either lack realism, produce unrealistic

argue that existing methods are limited because they employ a monolithic

different structural qualities that benefit from different representations.
Building on this insight, we generate avatars with a compositional model, in
which the head, face, and upper body are represented with traditional 3D
meshes, and the hair, clothing, and accessories with neural radiance fields
(NeRF). The model-based mesh representation provides a strong geometric prior

able to model and synthesize parts with complex geometry and appearance, such
as curly hair and fluffy scarves. Our novel system synthesizes these

human avatars. Towards this end, both explicit and implicit 3D representations
are heavily studied for a holistic modeling and capture of the whole human

choice in terms of representation efficacy since different parts of the human
avatar have different modeling desiderata. For example, meshes are generally
not suitable for modeling clothing and hair. Motivated by this, we present
Disentangled Avatars~(DELTA), which models humans with hybrid explicit-implicit
3D representations. DELTA takes a monocular RGB video as input, and produces a
human avatar with separate body and clothing/hair layers. Specifically, we
demonstrate two important applications for DELTA. For the first one, we
consider the disentanglement of the human body and clothing and in the second,
we disentangle the face and hair. To do so, DELTA represents the body or face
with an explicit mesh-based parametric 3D model and the clothing or hair with
an implicit neural radiance field. To make this possible, we design an
end-to-end differentiable renderer that integrates meshes into volumetric
rendering, enabling DELTA to learn directly from monocular videos without any
3D supervision. Finally, we show that how these two applications can be easily
combined to model full-body avatars, such that the hair, face, body and
clothing can be fully disentangled yet jointly rendered. Such a disentanglement
enables hair and clothing transfer to arbitrary body shapes. We empirically
validate the effectiveness of DELTA's disentanglement by demonstrating its

editing. However, editing 3D scenes is still in its early stages. It poses
various challenges, such as the requirement to design specific methods for
different editing types, retraining new models for various 3D scenes, and the
absence of convenient human interaction during editing. To tackle these issues,
we introduce a text-driven editing method, termed DN2N, which allows for the
direct acquisition of a NeRF model with universal editing capabilities,
eliminating the requirement for retraining. Our method employs off-the-shelf
text-based editing models of 2D images to modify the 3D scene images, followed
by a filtering process to discard poorly edited images that disrupt 3D
consistency. We then consider the remaining inconsistency as a problem of
removing noise perturbation, which can be solved by generating training data
with similar perturbation characteristics for training. We further propose
cross-view regularization terms to help the generalized NeRF model mitigate
these perturbations. Our text-driven method allows users to edit a 3D scene

practical than prior works. Empirical results show that our method achieves
multiple editing types, including but not limited to appearance editing,
weather transition, material changing, and style transfer. Most importantly,

results. Secondly, viewpoint changes in outdoor scenes cause ghosting or

requires independent optimization and storage for each new style, limiting
flexibility and efficient deployment. To overcome these challenges, we propose
DeformToon3D, an effective toonification framework tailored for hierarchical 3D
GAN. Our approach decomposes 3D toonification into subproblems of geometry and
texture stylization to better preserve the original latent space. Specifically,
we devise a novel StyleField that predicts conditional 3D deformation to align
a real-space NeRF to the style space for geometry stylization. Thanks to the
StyleField formulation, which already handles geometry stylization well,
texture stylization can be achieved conveniently via adaptive style mixing that
injects information of the artistic domain into the decoder of the pre-trained
3D GAN. Due to the unique design, our method enables flexible style degree
control and shape-texture-specific style swap. Furthermore, we achieve
efficient training without any real-world 2D-3D training pairs but proxy

photorealistic free-view rendering of scenes. However, NeRFs require dense
sampling of images in the given scene, and their performance degrades
significantly when only a sparse set of views are available. Researchers have
found that supervising the depth estimated by the NeRF helps train it
effectively with fewer views. The depth supervision is obtained either using
classical approaches or neural networks pre-trained on a large dataset. While
the former may provide only sparse supervision, the latter may suffer from
generalization issues. As opposed to the earlier approaches, we seek to learn
the depth supervision by designing augmented models and training them along
with the NeRF. We design augmented models that encourage simpler solutions by
exploring the role of positional encoding and view-dependent radiance in
training the few-shot NeRF. The depth estimated by these simpler models is used
to supervise the NeRF depth estimates. Since the augmented models can be
inaccurate in certain regions, we design a mechanism to choose only reliable
depth estimates for supervision. Finally, we add a consistency loss between the
coarse and fine multi-layer perceptrons of the NeRF to ensure better
utilization of hierarchical sampling. We achieve state-of-the-art

synthesis and 3D reconstruction for rendering. NeRFs achieve impressive results
on object-centric reconstructions, but the quality of novel view synthesis with
free-viewpoint navigation in complex environments (rooms, houses, etc) is often
problematic. While algorithmic improvements play an important role in the
resulting quality of novel view synthesis, in this work, we show that because
optimizing a NeRF is inherently a data-driven process, good quality data play a
fundamental role in the final quality of the reconstruction. As a consequence,
it is critical to choose the data samples -- in this case the cameras -- in a
way that will eventually allow the optimization to converge to a solution that
allows free-viewpoint navigation with good quality. Our main contribution is an
algorithm that efficiently proposes new camera placements that improve visual
quality with minimal assumptions. Our solution can be used with any NeRF model

gained popularity as a means of 3D scene stylization, thanks to the outstanding
performance of neural radiance fields in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis.
We highlight a research gap in radiance fields style transfer, the lack of
sufficient perceptual controllability, motivated by the existing concept in the
2D image style transfer. In this paper, we present ARF-Plus, a 3D neural style
transfer framework offering manageable control over perceptual factors, to
systematically explore the perceptual controllability in 3D scene stylization.
Four distinct types of controls - color preservation control, (style pattern)
scale control, spatial (selective stylization area) control, and depth
enhancement control - are proposed and integrated into this framework. Results
from real-world datasets, both quantitative and qualitative, show that the four
types of controls in our ARF-Plus framework successfully accomplish their
corresponding perceptual controls when stylizing 3D scenes. These techniques
work well for individual style inputs as well as for the simultaneous
application of multiple styles within a scene. This unlocks a realm of

the observation that different poses necessitate unique frequency assignments.
Neglecting this distinction yields noisy artifacts in smooth areas or blurs

advances in high-quality view synthesis. A major limitation of NeRF is its low
rendering efficiency due to the need for multiple network forwardings to render
a single pixel. Existing methods to improve NeRF either reduce the number of
required samples or optimize the implementation to accelerate the network
forwarding. Despite these efforts, the problem of multiple sampling persists
due to the intrinsic representation of radiance fields. In contrast, Neural
Light Fields (NeLF) reduce the computation cost of NeRF by querying only one
single network forwarding per pixel. To achieve a close visual quality to NeRF,
existing NeLF methods require significantly larger network capacities which
limits their rendering efficiency in practice. In this work, we propose a new
representation called Neural Radiance Distribution Field (NeRDF) that targets
efficient view synthesis in real-time. Specifically, we use a small network
similar to NeRF while preserving the rendering speed with a single network
forwarding per pixel as in NeLF. The key is to model the radiance distribution
along each ray with frequency basis and predict frequency weights using the
network. Pixel values are then computed via volume rendering on radiance
distributions. Experiments show that our proposed method offers a better
trade-off among speed, quality, and network size than existing methods: we
achieve a ~254x speed-up over NeRF with similar network size, with only a

synthesis are highly desired in the immersive communication, whereas it is
challenging due to the high deformation of hand and heavy occlusions between
hand and object. In this paper, we propose a neural rendering and pose

enable 3D hand-object interaction editing. We share the inspiration from recent
scene understanding work that shows a scene specific model built beforehand can
significantly improve and unblock vision tasks especially when inputs are

propose to solve the problem in two stages. We first learn the shape and
appearance prior knowledge of hands and objects separately with the neural
representation at the offline stage. During the online stage, we design a
rendering-based joint model fitting framework to understand the dynamic
hand-object interaction with the pre-built hand and object models as well as
interaction priors, which thereby overcomes penetration and separation issues
between hand and object and also enables novel view synthesis. In order to get
stable contact during the hand-object interaction process in a sequence, we
propose a stable contact loss to make the contact region to be consistent.

GNT, we first demonstrate that MoE can be neatly plugged in to enhance the

accurate camera parameters as input -- inaccurate camera parameters result in
blurry renderings. Extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters are usually
estimated using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods as a pre-processing step to
NeRF, but these techniques rarely yield perfect estimates. Thus, prior works
have proposed jointly optimizing camera parameters alongside a NeRF, but these
methods are prone to local minima in challenging settings. In this work, we
analyze how different camera parameterizations affect this joint optimization
problem, and observe that standard parameterizations exhibit large differences
in magnitude with respect to small perturbations, which can lead to an
ill-conditioned optimization problem. We propose using a proxy problem to
compute a whitening transform that eliminates the correlation between camera
parameters and normalizes their effects, and we propose to use this transform
as a preconditioner for the camera parameters during joint optimization. Our
preconditioned camera optimization significantly improves reconstruction
quality on scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset: we reduce error rates (RMSE)

Moreover, we introduce an alternating algorithm that harmoniously melds NeRF

However, previous works mostly focus on achieving photorealistic details,

rendering of reflective objects remain challenging problems. Recent methods
have shown significant improvements over the baselines in handling reflective

implicit-explicit approach based on conventional volume rendering to enhance
the reconstruction quality and accelerate the training and rendering processes.
We adopt an efficient density-based grid representation and reparameterize the

objects focus on novel-view synthesis and neglect correspondences. However,
time consistency enables advanced downstream tasks like 3D editing, motion
analysis, or virtual-asset creation. We propose SceNeRFlow to reconstruct a
general, non-rigid scene in a time-consistent manner. Our dynamic-NeRF method
takes multi-view RGB videos and background images from static cameras with
known camera parameters as input. It then reconstructs the deformations of an
estimated canonical model of the geometry and appearance in an online fashion.
Since this canonical model is time-invariant, we obtain correspondences even
for long-term, long-range motions. We employ neural scene representations to
parametrize the components of our method. Like prior dynamic-NeRF methods, we
use a backwards deformation model. We find non-trivial adaptations of this
model necessary to handle larger motions: We decompose the deformations into a
strongly regularized coarse component and a weakly regularized fine component,
where the coarse component also extends the deformation field into the space
surrounding the object, which enables tracking over time. We show
experimentally that, unlike prior work that only handles small motion, our
method enables the reconstruction of studio-scale motions.";Edith Tretschk<author:sep>Vladislav Golyanik<author:sep>Michael Zollhoefer<author:sep>Aljaz Bozic<author:sep>Christoph Lassner<author:sep>Christian Theobalt;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08258v1;cs.CV;Project page: https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/scenerflow/;nerf

increased the demand for high-quality three-dimensional (3D) graphical
representations. Industrial 3D applications encompass computer-aided design
(CAD), finite element analysis (FEA), scanning, and robotics. However, current
methods employed for industrial 3D representations suffer from high
implementation costs and reliance on manual human input for accurate 3D
modeling. To address these challenges, neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have
emerged as a promising approach for learning 3D scene representations based on
provided training 2D images. Despite a growing interest in NeRFs, their
potential applications in various industrial subdomains are still unexplored.
In this paper, we deliver a comprehensive examination of NeRF industrial

potential of NeRFs in the industrial domain. These experiments include
NeRF-based video compression techniques and using NeRFs for 3D motion

novel-view images of a given scene by learning an implicit representation with
only posed RGB images. NeRF and relevant neural field methods (e.g., neural
surface representation) typically optimize a point-wise loss and make
point-wise predictions, where one data point corresponds to one pixel.
Unfortunately, this line of research failed to use the collective supervision
of distant pixels, although it is known that pixels in an image or scene can
provide rich structural information. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to design a nonlocal multiplex training paradigm for NeRF and relevant
neural field methods via a novel Stochastic Structural SIMilarity (S3IM) loss
that processes multiple data points as a whole set instead of process multiple
inputs independently. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the unreasonable
effectiveness of S3IM in improving NeRF and neural surface representation for
nearly free. The improvements of quality metrics can be particularly
significant for those relatively difficult tasks: e.g., the test MSE loss
unexpectedly drops by more than 90% for TensoRF and DVGO over eight novel view

providing runtime assurance on the correctness of a camera pose estimate of a
monocular camera without relying on direct depth measurements. We leverage the
ability of NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) to render novel RGB perspectives of a
scene. We only require as input the camera image whose pose is being estimated,
an estimate of the camera pose we want to monitor, and a NeRF model containing
the scene pictured by the camera. We can then predict if the pose estimate is
within a desired distance from the ground truth and justify our prediction with
a level of confidence. VERF-Light does this by rendering a viewpoint with NeRF
at the estimated pose and estimating its relative offset to the sensor image up
to scale. Since scene scale is unknown, the approach renders another auxiliary
image and reasons over the consistency of the optical flows across the three
images. VERF-PnP takes a different approach by rendering a stereo pair of
images with NeRF and utilizing the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm. We
evaluate both methods on the LLFF dataset, on data from a Unitree A1 quadruped

poor scalability as requiring densely sampled images for each new scene.
Several studies have attempted to mitigate this problem by integrating
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) technique into NeRF while they still entail a
cumbersome fine-tuning process for new scenes. Notably, the rendering quality
will drop severely without this fine-tuning process and the errors mainly
appear around the high-frequency features. In the light of this observation, we
design WaveNeRF, which integrates wavelet frequency decomposition into MVS and
NeRF to achieve generalizable yet high-quality synthesis without any per-scene
optimization. To preserve high-frequency information when generating 3D feature
volumes, WaveNeRF builds Multi-View Stereo in the Wavelet domain by integrating
the discrete wavelet transform into the classical cascade MVS, which
disentangles high-frequency information explicitly. With that, disentangled
frequency features can be injected into classic NeRF via a novel hybrid neural
renderer to yield faithful high-frequency details, and an intuitive

reach a target in 3D space. Expanding on recent advances in the differentiable

develop an algorithm (DiffDRR) that efficiently computes Digitally
Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) and leverages automatic differentiation within
TensorFlow. Pose estimation is performed by iterative gradient descent using a
loss function that quantifies the similarity of the DRR synthesized from a
randomly initialized pose and the true fluoroscopic image at the target pose.
We propose two novel methods for high-fidelity view synthesis, Neural Tuned
Tomography (NeTT) and masked Neural Radiance Fields (mNeRF). Both methods rely
on classic Cone-Beam Computerized Tomography (CBCT); NeTT directly optimizes
the CBCT densities, while the non-zero values of mNeRF are constrained by a 3D
mask of the anatomic region segmented from CBCT. We demonstrate that both NeTT
and mNeRF distinctly improve pose estimation within our framework. By defining
a successful pose estimate to be a 3D angle error of less than 3 deg, we find
that NeTT and mNeRF can achieve similar results, both with overall success
rates more than 93%. However, the computational cost of NeTT is significantly
lower than mNeRF in both training and pose estimation. Furthermore, we show
that a NeTT trained for a single subject can generalize to synthesize

the word of a pre-recorded video through a text transcript editor. The key
challenge for this task is obtaining an editing model that generates new
talking-head video clips which simultaneously have accurate lip synchronization

in that they either require minutes of source videos and days of training time
or lack the disentangled control of verbal (e.g., lip motion) and non-verbal

this work, we fully utilize the video context to design a novel framework for
talking-head video editing, which achieves efficiency, disentangled motion
control, and sequential smoothness. Specifically, we decompose this framework
to motion prediction and motion-conditioned rendering: (1) We first design an
animation prediction module that efficiently obtains smooth and lip-sync motion
sequences conditioned on the driven speech. This module adopts a
non-autoregressive network to obtain context prior and improve the prediction
efficiency, and it learns a speech-animation mapping prior with better
generalization to novel speech from a multi-identity video dataset. (2) We then
introduce a neural rendering module to synthesize the photo-realistic and
full-head video frames given the predicted motion sequence. This module adopts
a pre-trained head topology and uses only few frames for efficient fine-tuning
to obtain a person-specific rendering model. Extensive experiments demonstrate

for its efficient training and fast inference capabilities, making it a
promising direction such as virtual reality and gaming. In particular,
PlenOctree (POT)[1], an explicit hierarchical multi-scale octree
representation, has emerged as a structural and influential framework. However,
POT's fixed structure for direct optimization is sub-optimal as the scene
complexity evolves continuously with updates to cached color and density,
necessitating refining the sampling distribution to capture signal complexity
accordingly. To address this issue, we propose the dynamic PlenOctree DOT,
which adaptively refines the sample distribution to adjust to changing scene
complexity. Specifically, DOT proposes a concise yet novel hierarchical feature
fusion strategy during the iterative rendering process. Firstly, it identifies
the regions of interest through training signals to ensure adaptive and
efficient refinement. Next, rather than directly filtering out valueless nodes,
DOT introduces the sampling and pruning operations for octrees to aggregate
features, enabling rapid parameter learning. Compared with POT, our DOT
outperforms it by enhancing visual quality, reducing over $55.15$/$68.84\%$

2D diffusion models trained on billions of image-text pairs. Existing methods
primarily rely on score distillation to leverage the 2D diffusion priors to

is prone to suffer the view inconsistency problem, and implicit NeRF modeling
can also lead to an arbitrary shape, thus leading to less realistic and

Points-to-3D to bridge the gap between sparse yet freely available 3D points

both 2D and 3D diffusion models. The core idea of Points-to-3D is to introduce
controllable sparse 3D points to guide the text-to-3D generation. Specifically,
we use the sparse point cloud generated from the 3D diffusion model, Point-E,
as the geometric prior, conditioned on a single reference image. To better
utilize the sparse 3D points, we propose an efficient point cloud guidance loss

have primarily used a SparseConvNet (SPC)-based human representation to process
the painted SMPL. However, such SPC-based representation i) optimizes under the

TransHE first processes the painted SMPL under the canonical space via
transformers for capturing the global relationships between human parts. Then,
DPaRF binds each output token with a deformable radiance field for encoding the
query point under the observation space. Finally, the FDI is employed to
further integrate fine-grained information from reference images. Extensive

To constrain the degree of freedom for optimization and lower the storage

scenes by sampling a single ray per pixel and it has demonstrated impressive
capabilities in novel-view synthesis from static scene images. However, in
practice, we usually need to recover NeRF from unconstrained image collections,
which poses two challenges: 1) the images often have dynamic changes in
appearance because of different capturing time and camera settings; 2) the
images may contain transient objects such as humans and cars, leading to
occlusion and ghosting artifacts. Conventional approaches seek to address these
challenges by locally utilizing a single ray to synthesize a color of a pixel.
In contrast, humans typically perceive appearance and objects by globally
utilizing information across multiple pixels. To mimic the perception process
of humans, in this paper, we propose Cross-Ray NeRF (CR-NeRF) that leverages
interactive information across multiple rays to synthesize occlusion-free novel
views with the same appearances as the images. Specifically, to model varying
appearances, we first propose to represent multiple rays with a novel cross-ray
feature and then recover the appearance by fusing global statistics, i.e.,
feature covariance of the rays and the image appearance. Moreover, to avoid
occlusion introduced by transient objects, we propose a transient objects
handler and introduce a grid sampling strategy for masking out the transient
objects. We theoretically find that leveraging correlation across multiple rays
promotes capturing more global information. Moreover, extensive experimental

These models capture a volumetric radiance field of a scene, creating highly

suffer from severe ambiguities in visual data inherent to the RGB sensor, which
means that although images generated with view synthesis can visually appear
very believable, the underlying 3D model will often be wrong. This considerably

fundamental and long-standing problem in ML. Recently, multi-scale encoding
schemes (such as Space2Vec and NeRF) were proposed to directly encode any point
in 2D/3D Euclidean space as a high-dimensional vector, and has been
successfully applied to various geospatial prediction and generative tasks.
However, all current 2D and 3D location encoders are designed to model point
distances in Euclidean space. So when applied to large-scale real-world GPS
coordinate datasets, which require distance metric learning on the spherical
surface, both types of models can fail due to the map projection distortion
problem (2D) and the spherical-to-Euclidean distance approximation error (3D).
To solve these problems, we propose a multi-scale location encoder called
Sphere2Vec which can preserve spherical distances when encoding point
coordinates on a spherical surface. We developed a unified view of
distance-reserving encoding on spheres based on the DFS. We also provide
theoretical proof that the Sphere2Vec preserves the spherical surface distance
between any two points, while existing encoding schemes do not. Experiments on
20 synthetic datasets show that Sphere2Vec can outperform all baseline models
on all these datasets with up to 30.8% error rate reduction. We then apply
Sphere2Vec to three geo-aware image classification tasks - fine-grained species
recognition, Flickr image recognition, and remote sensing image classification.
Results on 7 real-world datasets show the superiority of Sphere2Vec over
multiple location encoders on all three tasks. Further analysis shows that
Sphere2Vec outperforms other location encoder models, especially in the polar

this work, we present a novel Polychromatic neural representation (Polyner) to
tackle the challenging problem of CT imaging when metallic implants exist

metal's attenuation coefficients at various energy levels of the X-ray

images from metal-affected measurements hence poses a complicated nonlinear
inverse problem where empirical models adopted in previous metal artifact
reduction (MAR) approaches lead to signal loss and strongly aliased
reconstructions. Polyner instead models the MAR problem from a nonlinear
inverse problem perspective. Specifically, we first derive a polychromatic
forward model to accurately simulate the nonlinear CT acquisition process.
Then, we incorporate our forward model into the implicit neural representation

result in cross-view inconsistency and degradation of stylized view syntheses.
To address this challenge, we propose the Edit-DiffNeRF framework, which is
composed of a frozen diffusion model, a proposed delta module to edit the

the entire diffusion for each scene, our method focuses on editing the latent
semantic space in frozen pretrained diffusion models by the delta module. This

fine-grained modifications to the rendered views and effectively consolidate
these instructions in a 3D scene via NeRF training. As a result, we are able to
produce an edited 3D scene that faithfully aligns to input text instructions.
Furthermore, to ensure semantic consistency across different viewpoints, we
propose a novel multi-view semantic consistency loss that extracts a latent
semantic embedding from the input view as a prior, and aim to reconstruct it in

reconstructing 3D scenes from 2D images. Given a set of camera poses and
associated images, the models can be trained to synthesize novel, unseen views.
In order to expand the use cases for implicit neural representations, we need
to incorporate camera pose estimation capabilities as part of the
representation learning, as this is necessary for reconstructing scenes from
real-world video sequences where cameras are generally not being tracked.
Existing approaches like COLMAP and, most recently, bundle-adjusting neural
radiance field methods often suffer from lengthy processing times. These delays
ranging from hours to days, arise from laborious feature matching, hardware
limitations, dense point sampling, and long training times required by a
multi-layer perceptron structure with a large number of parameters. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework called bundle-adjusting accelerated
neural graphics primitives (BAA-NGP). Our approach leverages accelerated
sampling and hash encoding to expedite both pose refinement/estimation and 3D
scene reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
a more than 10 to 20 $\times$ speed improvement in novel view synthesis

In this work, we propose to model the 3D parameter as a random variable instead

principled particle-based variational framework to explain and address the
aforementioned issues in text-to-3D generation. We show that SDS is a special
case of VSD and leads to poor samples with both small and large CFG weights. In
comparison, VSD works well with various CFG weights as ancestral sampling from
diffusion models and simultaneously improves the diversity and sample quality
with a common CFG weight (i.e., $7.5$). We further present various improvements
in the design space for text-to-3D such as distillation time schedule and
density initialization, which are orthogonal to the distillation algorithm yet
not well explored. Our overall approach, dubbed ProlificDreamer, can generate

years ago, how to precisely model the propagation of an RF signal in an
electrically large and complex environment remains a long-standing problem. The
difficulty is in the complex interactions between the RF signal and the
obstacles (e.g., reflection, diffraction, etc.). Inspired by the great success
of using a neural network to describe the optical field in computer vision, we
propose a neural radio-frequency radiance field, NeRF$^\textbf{2}$, which
represents a continuous volumetric scene function that makes sense of an RF
signal's propagation. Particularly, after training with a few signal
measurements, NeRF$^\textbf{2}$ can tell how/what signal is received at any
position when it knows the position of a transmitter. As a physical-layer
neural network, NeRF$^\textbf{2}$ can take advantage of the learned statistic
model plus the physical model of ray tracing to generate a synthetic dataset
that meets the training demands of application-layer artificial neural networks
(ANNs). Thus, we can boost the performance of ANNs by the proposed
turbo-learning, which mixes the true and synthetic datasets to intensify the
training. Our experiment results show that turbo-learning can enhance
performance with an approximate 50% increase. We also demonstrate the power of
NeRF$^\textbf{2}$ in the field of indoor localization and 5G MIMO.";Xiaopeng Zhao<author:sep>Zhenlin An<author:sep>Qingrui Pan<author:sep>Lei Yang;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06118v2;cs.NI;;nerf

ingredient of neural surface reconstruction. We build on the successful recent
method NeuS to extend it by three new components. The first component is to
borrow the tri-plane representation from EG3D and represent signed distance
fields as a mixture of tri-planes and MLPs instead of representing it with MLPs
only. Using tri-planes leads to a more expressive data structure but will also
introduce noise in the reconstructed surface. The second component is to use a
new type of positional encoding with learnable weights to combat noise in the
reconstruction process. We divide the features in the tri-plane into multiple
frequency scales and modulate them with sin and cos functions of different
frequencies. The third component is to use learnable convolution operations on
the tri-plane features using self-attention convolution to produce features
with different frequency bands. The experiments show that PET-NeuS achieves
high-fidelity surface reconstruction on standard datasets. Following previous
work and using the Chamfer metric as the most important way to measure surface
reconstruction quality, we are able to improve upon the NeuS baseline by 57% on

synthesis by encoding neural representations of a scene. However, NeRFs require
hundreds of images per scene to synthesize photo-realistic novel views.
Training them on sparse input views leads to overfitting and incorrect scene
depth estimation resulting in artifacts in the rendered novel views. Sparse
input NeRFs were recently regularized by providing dense depth estimated from
pre-trained networks as supervision, to achieve improved performance over
sparse depth constraints. However, we find that such depth priors may be
inaccurate due to generalization issues. Instead, we hypothesize that the
visibility of pixels in different input views can be more reliably estimated to
provide dense supervision. In this regard, we compute a visibility prior
through the use of plane sweep volumes, which does not require any
pre-training. By regularizing the NeRF training with the visibility prior, we
successfully train the NeRF with few input views. We reformulate the NeRF to
also directly output the visibility of a 3D point from a given viewpoint to
reduce the training time with the visibility constraint. On multiple datasets,
our model outperforms the competing sparse input NeRF models including those

to the impressively high quality in 3D scene reconstruction and novel view
synthesis. However, image degradation caused by the scattering of atmospheric
light and object light by particles in the atmosphere can significantly
decrease the reconstruction quality when shooting scenes in hazy conditions. To
address this issue, we propose Dehazing-NeRF, a method that can recover clear
NeRF from hazy image inputs. Our method simulates the physical imaging process
of hazy images using an atmospheric scattering model, and jointly learns the
atmospheric scattering model and a clean NeRF model for both image dehazing and
novel view synthesis. Different from previous approaches, Dehazing-NeRF is an
unsupervised method with only hazy images as the input, and also does not rely
on hand-designed dehazing priors. By jointly combining the depth estimated from
the NeRF 3D scene with the atmospheric scattering model, our proposed model
breaks through the ill-posed problem of single-image dehazing while maintaining
geometric consistency. Besides, to alleviate the degradation of image quality
caused by information loss, soft margin consistency regularization, as well as
atmospheric consistency and contrast discriminative loss, are addressed during
the model training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms the simple combination of single-image dehazing and NeRF on both

the underlying explanatory factors of 3D data, which helps AI fundamentally
understand our 3D world. This task is currently under-explored and poses great
challenges: (i) the 3D representations are complex and in general contains much
more information than 2D image; (ii) many 3D representations are not well
suited for gradient-based optimization, let alone disentanglement. To address
these challenges, we use NeRF as a differentiable 3D representation, and
introduce a self-supervised Navigation to identify interpretable semantic
directions in the latent space. To our best knowledge, this novel method,
dubbed NaviNeRF, is the first work to achieve fine-grained 3D disentanglement
without any priors or supervisions. Specifically, NaviNeRF is built upon the
generative NeRF pipeline, and equipped with an Outer Navigation Branch and an
Inner Refinement Branch. They are complementary -- the outer navigation is to
identify global-view semantic directions, and the inner refinement dedicates to
fine-grained attributes. A synergistic loss is further devised to coordinate
two branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NaviNeRF has a superior
fine-grained 3D disentanglement ability than the previous 3D-aware models. Its
performance is also comparable to editing-oriented models relying on semantic

NeRFs using autonomous embodied agents. Our method allows an agent to explore
an unseen environment efficiently and use the experience to build an implicit
map representation autonomously. We compare the impact of different exploration
strategies including handcrafted frontier-based exploration, end-to-end and
modular approaches composed of trained high-level planners and classical
low-level path followers. We train these models with different reward functions
tailored to this problem and evaluate the quality of the learned

rendering, map reconstruction, planning, and pose refinement. Empirical results
show that NeRFs can be trained on actively collected data using just a single
episode of experience in an unseen environment, and can be used for several
downstream robotic tasks, and that modular trained exploration models
outperform other classical and end-to-end baselines. Finally, we show that

holistic shape reconstruction (HSR) of complex objects utilizing a
Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD)-based time-of-flight sensor. As
illustrated in Fig. 1, our method enables new capabilities to reconstruct
near-$360^\circ$ surrounding geometry of an object from a single scan spot. In
such a scenario, traditional line-of-sight (LOS) imaging methods only see the
front part of the object and typically fail to recover the occluded back
regions. Inspired by recent advances of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging
techniques which have demonstrated great power to reconstruct occluded objects,
Omni-LOS marries LOS and NLOS together, leveraging their complementary
advantages to jointly recover the holistic shape of the object from a single
scan position. The core of our method is to put the object nearby diffuse walls
and augment the LOS scan in the front view with the NLOS scans from the
surrounding walls, which serve as virtual ``mirrors'' to trap lights toward the
object. Instead of separately recovering the LOS and NLOS signals, we adopt an
implicit neural network to represent the object, analogous to NeRF and NeTF.
While transients are measured along straight rays in LOS but over the spherical
wavefronts in NLOS, we derive differentiable ray propagation models to
simultaneously model both types of transient measurements so that the NLOS
reconstruction also takes into account the direct LOS measurements and vice
versa. We further develop a proof-of-concept Omni-LOS hardware prototype for
real-world validation. Comprehensive experiments on various wall settings
demonstrate that Omni-LOS successfully resolves shape ambiguities caused by
occlusions, achieves high-fidelity 3D scan quality, and manages to recover

To address this issue, Mip-NeRF proposes a multiscale representation as a

only suitable for offline rendering since it relies on integrated positional

scene scale using the level of detail (LOD) derived from ray differentials and
uses quadrilinear interpolation to map a queried 3D location to its features

NeRF cannot achieve satisfactory results, as it only focuses on learning
individual pixels while ignoring local information, especially at low texture
areas, resulting in poor geometry. To this end, we have taken steps to address

constancy with Tx$^2$Former, a novel way to combine two Transformer layers, to
separate appearance constancy and uniqueness. Appearance constancy models the
general shape across the video, and uniqueness models the unique patterns for
each frame. We further introduce a novel Covariance Loss to limit the

Most pioneering methods rely primarily on 2D representations and thus will

Nevertheless, the fidelity of identity and expression is not so desirable,

changes; an event-based camera observes the change as sparse events. How can we
utilize sparse events for efficient recovery of the camera pose? We show that
we can recover the camera pose by minimizing the error between sparse events
and the temporal gradient of the scene represented as a neural radiance field
(NeRF). To enable the computation of the temporal gradient of the scene, we
augment NeRF's camera pose as a time function. When the input pose to the NeRF
coincides with the actual pose, the output of the temporal gradient of NeRF
equals the observed intensity changes on the event's points. Using this
principle, we propose an event-based camera pose tracking framework called
TeGRA which realizes the pose update by using the sparse event's observation.

neural reflectance field model, which learns albedos, normals, and volume
densities of the underwater environment. We introduce a logistic regression
model to separate water from the scene and apply distinct light physics during
training. Our method avoids the need to estimate complex backscatter effects in
water by employing several approximations, enhancing sampling efficiency and
numerical stability during training. The proposed technique integrates

compositional synthesis of driving scenes in a physically consistent manner.
Specifically, we learn a scene representation that disentangles the static
background and transient elements into a world-NeRF and class-specific
object-NeRFs to allow compositional synthesis of multiple objects in the scene.
Furthermore, we explicitly designed both the world and object models to handle
lighting variation, which allows us to compose objects into scenes with
spatially varying lighting. This is achieved by constructing a light field of
the scene and using it in conjunction with a learned shader to modulate the
appearance of the object NeRFs. We demonstrate the performance of our model on
a synthetic dataset of diverse lighting conditions rendered with the CARLA

field by disentangling backward and forward deformation correspondences into
shared skeletal motion weight and separate non-rigid motions. Then, we devise a
Forward Correspondence Search module, which queries the correspondence feature

as a function of corresponding coordinates which emerges as a sharp weapon for
solving inverse problems. However, the expressive power of INR is limited by
the spectral bias in the network training. In this paper, we find that such a
frequency-related problem could be greatly solved by re-arranging the
coordinates of the input signal, for which we propose the disorder-invariant
implicit neural representation (DINER) by augmenting a hash-table to a
traditional INR backbone. Given discrete signals sharing the same histogram of
attributes and different arrangement orders, the hash-table could project the
coordinates into the same distribution for which the mapped signal can be
better modeled using the subsequent INR network, leading to significantly
alleviated spectral bias. Furthermore, the expressive power of the DINER is
determined by the width of the hash-table. Different width corresponds to
different geometrical elements in the attribute space, \textit{e.g.}, 1D curve,
2D curved-plane and 3D curved-volume when the width is set as $1$, $2$ and $3$,
respectively. More covered areas of the geometrical elements result in stronger
expressive power. Experiments not only reveal the generalization of the DINER

table-based position encoder for position embedding. We split the position
encoder into two parts, the content and style sub-branches, and train the
network for normal novel view image synthesis with the content and style

position encoder, with content and style voxel grid features as reference. With
the adjusted features, the stylization of novel view images could be obtained.
Our method extends the style target from style images to image sets of scenes
and does not require additional network training for stylization. Given a set
of images of 3D scenes and a style target(a style image or another set of 3D

widespread attention, aiming to super sample medical volumes at arbitrary

generalization ability, which restricts their application in various scenarios.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Cube-based Neural Radiance Field
(CuNeRF), a zero-shot MIASSR framework that can yield medical images at
arbitrary scales and viewpoints in a continuous domain. Unlike existing MIASSR
methods that fit the mapping between low-resolution (LR) and HR volumes, CuNeRF
focuses on building a coordinate-intensity continuous representation from LR
volumes without the need for HR references. This is achieved by the proposed
differentiable modules: including cube-based sampling, isotropic volume
rendering, and cube-based hierarchical rendering. Through extensive experiments
on magnetic resource imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) modalities, we
demonstrate that CuNeRF outperforms state-of-the-art MIASSR methods. CuNeRF

number of views are available. To complement the lack of 3D information,
depth-based models, such as DSNeRF and MonoSDF, explicitly assume the
availability of accurate depth maps of multiple views. They linearly scale the
accurate depth maps as supervision to guide the predicted depth of few-shot
NeRFs. However, accurate depth maps are difficult and expensive to capture due
to wide-range depth distances in the wild.
  In this work, we present a new Sparse-view NeRF (SparseNeRF) framework that
exploits depth priors from real-world inaccurate observations. The inaccurate
depth observations are either from pre-trained depth models or coarse depth
maps of consumer-level depth sensors. Since coarse depth maps are not strictly
scaled to the ground-truth depth maps, we propose a simple yet effective
constraint, a local depth ranking method, on NeRFs such that the expected depth
ranking of the NeRF is consistent with that of the coarse depth maps in local
patches. To preserve the spatial continuity of the estimated depth of NeRF, we
further propose a spatial continuity constraint to encourage the consistency of
the expected depth continuity of NeRF with coarse depth maps. Surprisingly,
with simple depth ranking constraints, SparseNeRF outperforms all
state-of-the-art few-shot NeRF methods (including depth-based models) on

this approach often fails drastically on challenging specular objects in

an off-the-shelf skeleton estimator is first employed to parameterize the hand
poses. Then we design a pose-driven deformation field to establish
correspondence from those different poses to a shared canonical space, where a
pose-disentangled NeRF for one hand is optimized. Such unified modeling
efficiently complements the geometry and texture cues in rarely-observed areas
for both hands. Meanwhile, we further leverage the pose priors to generate
pseudo depth maps as guidance for occlusion-aware density learning. Moreover, a
neural feature distillation method is proposed to achieve cross-domain

optimising a continuous volumetric scene function. Its large success which lies
in applying volumetric rendering (VR) is also its Achilles' heel in producing
view-dependent effects. As a consequence, glossy and transparent surfaces often
appear murky. A remedy to reduce these artefacts is to constrain this VR
equation by excluding volumes with back-facing normal. While this approach has
some success in rendering glossy surfaces, translucent objects are still poorly
represented. In this paper, we present an alternative to the physics-based VR
approach by introducing a self-attention-based framework on volumes along a

store local lighting passing through the scene, we incorporate Learnable
Embeddings to capture view dependent effects within the scene. Our method,

high-resolution and high-fidelity generative modeling of human heads with a
possibility for novel view rendering. At the same time, one must solve an
inverse problem to be able to re-render or modify an existing image or video.
Despite the success of universal optimization-based methods for 2D GAN
inversion, those applied to 3D GANs may fail to extrapolate the result onto the
novel view, whereas optimization-based 3D GAN inversion methods are
time-consuming and can require at least several minutes per image. Fast
encoder-based techniques, such as those developed for StyleGAN, may also be
less appealing due to the lack of identity preservation. Our work introduces a
fast technique that bridges the gap between the two approaches by directly
utilizing the tri-plane representation presented for the EG3D generative model.
In particular, we build upon a feed-forward convolutional encoder for the
latent code and extend it with a fully-convolutional predictor of tri-plane
numerical offsets. The renderings are similar in quality to the ones produced
by optimization-based techniques and outperform the ones by encoder-based

witnessed the rise of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Nevertheless, it is not
trivial to exploit NeRF for the photorealistic 3D scene stylization task, which
aims to generate visually consistent and photorealistic stylized scenes from
novel views. Simply coupling NeRF with photorealistic style transfer (PST) will
result in cross-view inconsistency and degradation of stylized view syntheses.
Through a thorough analysis, we demonstrate that this non-trivial task can be
simplified in a new light: When transforming the appearance representation of a
pre-trained NeRF with Lipschitz mapping, the consistency and photorealism
across source views will be seamlessly encoded into the syntheses. That
motivates us to build a concise and flexible learning framework namely LipRF,
which upgrades arbitrary 2D PST methods with Lipschitz mapping tailored for the
3D scene. Technically, LipRF first pre-trains a radiance field to reconstruct
the 3D scene, and then emulates the style on each view by 2D PST as the prior
to learn a Lipschitz network to stylize the pre-trained appearance. In view of
that Lipschitz condition highly impacts the expressivity of the neural network,
we devise an adaptive regularization to balance the reconstruction and
stylization. A gradual gradient aggregation strategy is further introduced to
optimize LipRF in a cost-efficient manner. We conduct extensive experiments to
show the high quality and robust performance of LipRF on both photorealistic 3D

framework for synthesizing a 3D scene using object proxies. A proxy represents
the object's placement in the generated scene and optionally defines its coarse

NeRF. We alternate between optimizing each NeRF on its own and as part of the
full scene. Thus, a complete representation of each object can be learned,
while also creating a harmonious scene with style and lighting match. We show
that using proxies allows a wide variety of editing options, such as adjusting

in this paper, we propose a novel NeRF-based LiDAR odometry and mapping

sampling-invariant content transformation that makes the transformation
invariant to the holistic statistics of the sampled 3D points and accordingly
ensures multi-view consistency. The second is deferred style transformation of
2D feature maps which is equivalent to the transformation of 3D points but
greatly reduces memory footprint without degrading multi-view consistency.

which may not optimally increase data diversity in 3D real-world scenarios. To
this end, we propose a 3D data augmentation approach termed Drive-3DAug, aiming
at augmenting the driving scenes on camera in the 3D space. We first utilize
Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to reconstruct the 3D models of background and

the 3D objects with adapted location and orientation at the pre-defined valid
region of backgrounds. As such, the training database could be effectively
scaled up. However, the 3D object modeling is constrained to the image quality
and the limited viewpoints. To overcome these problems, we modify the original
NeRF by introducing a geometric rectified loss and a symmetric-aware training

Additionally, we introduce a training strategy that enables the 2D diffusion

reach real-time performance when rendering at a high resolution, and often
requires huge local computing resources. In this paper, we resort to cloud
rendering and present NEPHELE, a neural platform for highly realistic cloud
radiance rendering. In stark contrast with existing NR approaches, our NEPHELE
allows for more powerful rendering capabilities by combining multiple remote
GPUs and facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple people to view the same
NeRF scene simultaneously. We introduce i-NOLF to employ opacity light fields
for ultra-fast neural radiance rendering in a one-query-per-ray manner. We
further resemble the Lumigraph with geometry proxies for fast ray querying and
subsequently employ a small MLP to model the local opacity lumishperes for
high-quality rendering. We also adopt Perfect Spatial Hashing in i-NOLF to
enhance cache coherence. As a result, our i-NOLF achieves an order of magnitude
performance gain in terms of efficiency than i-NGP, especially for the
multi-user multi-viewpoint setting under cloud rendering scenarios. We further
tailor a task scheduler accompanied by our i-NOLF representation and
demonstrate the advance of our methodological design through a comprehensive
cloud platform, consisting of a series of cooperated modules, i.e., render
farms, task assigner, frame composer, and detailed streaming strategies. Using

effects, we further propose to encode the rendering equation in the feature
space by employing the anisotropic spherical Gaussian mixture predicted from
the proposed multiscale representation. The proposed NRFF improves
state-of-the-art rendering results by over 1 dB in PSNR on both the NeRF and

Also, the onboard cameras perceive scenes without much overlapping. Thus,
existing NeRFs often produce blurs, 'floaters' and other artifacts on

image rendering given a camera pose. The recorded latent codes implicitly
contain visual information about the environment, which makes the RNR-Map
visually descriptive. This visual information in RNR-Map can be a useful
guideline for visual localization and navigation. We develop localization and
navigation frameworks that can effectively utilize the RNR-Map. We evaluate the
proposed frameworks on camera tracking, visual localization, and image-goal
navigation. Experimental results show that the RNR-Map-based localization
framework can find the target location based on a single query image with fast

to the development of neural radiance fields (NeRF). Recently, to generate and

potentials for high-quality 3D shape generation. However, most existing work
based on diffusion models only focus on geometric shape generation, they cannot
either accomplish 3D reconstruction from a single image, or produce 3D
geometric shape with color information. In this work, we propose to reconstruct
a 3D colored shape from a single RGB image through a novel conditional
diffusion model. The reverse process of the proposed diffusion model is
consisted of three modules, shape prediction module, color prediction module
and NeRF-like rendering module. In shape prediction module, the reference RGB
image is first encoded into a high-level shape feature and then the shape
feature is utilized as a condition to predict the reverse geometric noise in
diffusion model. Then the color of each 3D point updated in shape prediction
module is predicted by color prediction module. Finally, a NeRF-like rendering
module is designed to render the colored point cloud predicted by the former
two modules to 2D image space to guide the training conditioned only on a
reference image. As far as the authors know, the proposed method is the first
diffusion model for 3D colored shape reconstruction from a single RGB image.

free-viewpoint videos. However, they are inherently unsuitable for interactive
streaming scenarios (e.g. video conferencing, telepresence) because have an
inevitable lag even if the training is instantaneous. This is because these
approaches consume videos and thus have to buffer chunks of frames (often
seconds) before processing. In this work, we take a step towards interactive
streaming via a frame-by-frame approach naturally free of lag. Conventional
wisdom believes that per-frame NeRFs are impractical due to prohibitive
training costs and storage. We break this belief by introducing Incremental
Neural Videos (INV), a per-frame NeRF that is efficiently trained and
streamable. We designed INV based on two insights: (1) Our main finding is that
MLPs naturally partition themselves into Structure and Color Layers, which
store structural and color/texture information respectively. (2) We leverage
this property to retain and improve upon knowledge from previous frames, thus
amortizing training across frames and reducing redundant learning. As a result,
with negligible changes to NeRF, INV can achieve good qualities (>28.6db) in
8min/frame. It can also outperform prior SOTA in 19% less training time.
Additionally, our Temporal Weight Compression reduces the per-frame size to
0.3MB/frame (6.6% of NeRF). More importantly, INV is free from buffer lag and
is naturally fit for streaming. While this work does not achieve real-time
training, it shows that incremental approaches like INV present new
possibilities in interactive 3D streaming. Moreover, our discovery of natural
information partition leads to a better understanding and manipulation of MLPs.

radiance field from monocular videos. Different from most existing NeRF methods
that are based on multiple views, monocular videos only contain one view at
each timestamp, thereby suffering from ambiguity along the view direction in
estimating point features and scene flows. Previous studies such as DynNeRF
disambiguate point features by positional encoding, which is not transferable
and severely limits the generalization ability. As a result, these methods have
to train one independent model for each scene and suffer from heavy
computational costs when applying to increasing monocular videos in real-world
applications. To address this, We propose MonoNeRF to simultaneously learn
point features and scene flows with point trajectory and feature correspondence
constraints across frames. More specifically, we learn an implicit velocity
field to estimate point trajectory from temporal features with Neural ODE,
which is followed by a flow-based feature aggregation module to obtain spatial
features along the point trajectory. We jointly optimize temporal and spatial
features in an end-to-end manner. Experiments show that our MonoNeRF is able to
learn from multiple scenes and support new applications such as scene editing,
unseen frame synthesis, and fast novel scene adaptation. Codes are available at

  In this work, we present PaletteNeRF, a novel method for photorealistic

approach captures the synergies of these two problems: reliable camera pose
estimation gives rise to accurate shape reconstruction, and the accurate

into a neural radiance field. The reconstruction results are rendered by volume
rendering techniques, enabling us to train the model without 3D shape
ground-truth. Our experiments show that FORGE reliably reconstructs objects

user interactions. We achieve this by encouraging a pre-trained StyleGAN model
and a NeRF model to learn from each other mutually. Specifically, we use a NeRF
model to generate numerous image-angle pairs to train an adjustor, which can
adjust the StyleGAN latent code to generate high-fidelity stylized images for
any given angle. To extrapolate editing to GAN out-of-domain views, we devise
another module that is trained in a self-supervised learning manner. This
module maps novel-view images to the hidden space of StyleGAN that allows
StyleGAN to generate stylized images on novel views. These two modules together
produce guided images in 360{\deg}views to finetune a NeRF to make stylization
effects, where a stable fine-tuning strategy is proposed to achieve this.

images has dramatically improved with the advent of neural radiance fields
(NeRF). This study proposes two novel techniques that effectively build NeRF
for 360{\textdegree} omnidirectional images. Due to the characteristics of a
360{\textdegree} image of ERP format that has spatial distortion in their high
latitude regions and a 360{\textdegree} wide viewing angle, NeRF's general ray
sampling strategy is ineffective. Hence, the view synthesis accuracy of NeRF is
limited and learning is not efficient. We propose two non-uniform ray sampling
schemes for NeRF to suit 360{\textdegree} images - distortion-aware ray
sampling and content-aware ray sampling. We created an evaluation dataset
Synth360 using Replica and SceneCity models of indoor and outdoor scenes,
respectively. In experiments, we show that our proposal successfully builds
360{\textdegree} image NeRF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The
proposal is widely applicable to advanced variants of NeRF. DietNeRF, AugNeRF,
and NeRF++ combined with the proposed techniques further improve the
performance. Moreover, we show that our proposed method enhances the quality of
real-world scenes in 360{\textdegree} images. Synth360:

high-quality and versatile representations for 3D scenes, and enable downstream
tasks such as editing, retrieval, navigation, etc. Various neural architectures
are vying for the core structure of NeRF, including the plain Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP), sparse tensors, low-rank tensors, hashtables and their
compositions. Each of these representations has its particular set of
trade-offs. For example, the hashtable-based representations admit faster
training and rendering but their lack of clear geometric meaning hampers
downstream tasks like spatial-relation-aware editing. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Volume Distillation (PVD), a systematic distillation method that
allows any-to-any conversions between different architectures, including MLP,
sparse or low-rank tensors, hashtables and their compositions. PVD consequently
empowers downstream applications to optimally adapt the neural representations
for the task at hand in a post hoc fashion. The conversions are fast, as
distillation is progressively performed on different levels of volume
representations, from shallower to deeper. We also employ special treatment of
density to deal with its specific numerical instability problem. Empirical
evidence is presented to validate our method on the NeRF-Synthetic, LLFF and
TanksAndTemples datasets. For example, with PVD, an MLP-based NeRF model can be
distilled from a hashtable-based Instant-NGP model at a 10X~20X faster speed

directions for improving NeRF, represented by methods like Plenoxels and DVGO,
which achieve super-fast training convergence and real-time rendering. However,
these methods typically require a tremendous storage overhead, costing up to
hundreds of megabytes of disk space and runtime memory for a single scene. We
address this issue in this paper by introducing a simple yet effective
framework, called vector quantized radiance fields (VQRF), for compressing
these volume-grid-based radiance fields. We first present a robust and adaptive
metric for estimating redundancy in grid models and performing voxel pruning by
better exploring intermediate outputs of volumetric rendering. A trainable
vector quantization is further proposed to improve the compactness of grid
models. In combination with an efficient joint tuning strategy and
post-processing, our method can achieve a compression ratio of 100$\times$ by
reducing the overall model size to 1 MB with negligible loss on visual quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of
achieving unrivaled performance and well generalization across multiple methods

practical 3D modeling pipelines such as 3D scene creation and rendering. Due to
the technical difficulty, one can only obtain rough 3D models (R3DMs) for most
real objects using existing 3D reconstruction techniques. As a result,
physically-based rendering (PBR) would render low-quality images or videos for
scenes that are constructed by R3DMs. One promising solution would be
representing real-world objects as Neural Fields such as NeRFs, which are able
to generate photo-realistic renderings of an object under desired viewpoints.
However, a drawback is that the synthesized views through Neural Fields
Rendering (NFR) cannot reflect the simulated lighting details on R3DMs in PBR
pipelines, especially when object interactions in the 3D scene creation cause
local shadows. To solve this dilemma, we propose a lighting transfer network
(LighTNet) to bridge NFR and PBR, such that they can benefit from each other.
LighTNet reasons about a simplified image composition model, remedies the
uneven surface issue caused by R3DMs, and is empowered by several

can provide 3D priors as condition information for the following diffusion
process. During denoising diffusion, we further enhance the 3D consistency by
modeling cross-view correspondences with a novel two-stream (corresponding to
two different views) asynchronous diffusion process. Second, we study 3D local
editing and propose a two-step solution that can generate 360-degree

photo-realistic 3D head avatar from just a monocular video. Unfortunately, the
training process of the NeRF-based methods is quite time-consuming, as MLP used
in the NeRF-based methods is inefficient and requires too many iterations to
converge. To overcome this problem, we propose AvatarMAV, a fast 3D head avatar
reconstruction method using Motion-Aware Neural Voxels. AvatarMAV is the first
to model both the canonical appearance and the decoupled expression motion by
neural voxels for head avatar. In particular, the motion-aware neural voxels is
generated from the weighted concatenation of multiple 4D tensors. The 4D
tensors semantically correspond one-to-one with 3DMM expression basis and share
the same weights as 3DMM expression coefficients. Benefiting from our novel
representation, the proposed AvatarMAV can recover photo-realistic head avatars
in just 5 minutes (implemented with pure PyTorch), which is significantly

controllable face image synthesis methods are able to generate high-fidelity

previous methods focus on controllable 2D image generative models, which are
prone to producing inconsistent face images under large expression and pose

increases algorithm performance, there are hard limitations to the number and

render synthetic views from arbitrary camera positions, virtually enlarging the

paired calibrated camera parameters. However, previous NeRF-based systems have
been demonstrated under strictly controlled settings, with little attention
paid to less ideal scenarios, including with the presence of noise such as
exposure, illumination changes, and blur. In particular, though blur frequently
occurs in real situations, NeRF that can handle blurred images has received
little attention. The few studies that have investigated NeRF for blurred
images have not considered geometric and appearance consistency in 3D space,
which is one of the most important factors in 3D reconstruction. This leads to
inconsistency and the degradation of the perceptual quality of the constructed

derived from the actual blurring process during image acquisition by the
camera. DP-NeRF proposes rigid blurring kernel to impose 3D consistency
utilizing the physical priors and adaptive weight proposal to refine the color

applications, intuitively editing NeRF scenes is still an open challenge. One
important editing task is the removal of unwanted objects from a 3D scene, such
that the replaced region is visually plausible and consistent with its context.
We refer to this task as 3D inpainting. In 3D, solutions must be both
consistent across multiple views and geometrically valid. In this paper, we
propose a novel 3D inpainting method that addresses these challenges. Given a
small set of posed images and sparse annotations in a single input image, our
framework first rapidly obtains a 3D segmentation mask for a target object.
Using the mask, a perceptual optimizationbased approach is then introduced that
leverages learned 2D image inpainters, distilling their information into 3D
space, while ensuring view consistency. We also address the lack of a diverse
benchmark for evaluating 3D scene inpainting methods by introducing a dataset
comprised of challenging real-world scenes. In particular, our dataset contains
views of the same scene with and without a target object, enabling more
principled benchmarking of the 3D inpainting task. We first demonstrate the
superiority of our approach on multiview segmentation, comparing to NeRFbased

their ability to synthesize novel scene views with great accuracy. However,
inherent to their underlying formulation, the sampling of points along a ray

the recent variant mip-NeRF proposes an Integrated Positional Encoding (IPE)

formulation, mip-NeRF instead approximates this integral as the expected value
of a multivariate Gaussian distribution. This approximation is reliable for
short frustums but degrades with highly elongated regions, which arises when
dealing with distant scene objects under a larger depth of field. In this

an intermediary for geometry editing. We devise a geometry decoder (whose
output is unchanged when the appearance changes) and an appearance decoder. The
geometry decoder aligns the original facial volume with the semantic mask
volume. We also enhance the disentanglement by explicitly regularizing rendered
images with the same appearance but different geometry to be similar in terms
of color distribution for each facial component separately. Our method allows

inspiring major breakthroughs in text-guided shape generation. Recently, it has
been shown that using score distillation, one can successfully text-guide a
NeRF model to generate a 3D object. We adapt the score distillation to the
publicly available, and computationally efficient, Latent Diffusion Models,
which apply the entire diffusion process in a compact latent space of a
pretrained autoencoder. As NeRFs operate in image space, a naive solution for
guiding them with latent score distillation would require encoding to the
latent space at each guidance step. Instead, we propose to bring the NeRF to
the latent space, resulting in a Latent-NeRF. Analyzing our Latent-NeRF, we
show that while Text-to-3D models can generate impressive results, they are
inherently unconstrained and may lack the ability to guide or enforce a
specific 3D structure. To assist and direct the 3D generation, we propose to
guide our Latent-NeRF using a Sketch-Shape: an abstract geometry that defines
the coarse structure of the desired object. Then, we present means to integrate
such a constraint directly into a Latent-NeRF. This unique combination of text
and shape guidance allows for increased control over the generation process. We
also show that latent score distillation can be successfully applied directly
on 3D meshes. This allows for generating high-quality textures on a given
geometry. Our experiments validate the power of our different forms of guidance

with GAN inversion for 2D generative models, NeRF inversion not only needs to
1) preserve the identity of the input image, but also 2) ensure 3D consistency
in generated novel views. This requires the latent code obtained from the
single-view image to be invariant across multiple views. To address this new
challenge, we propose a two-stage encoder for style-based NeRF inversion. In
the first stage, we introduce a base encoder that converts the input image to a
latent code. To ensure the latent code is view-invariant and is able to
synthesize 3D consistent novel view images, we utilize identity contrastive
learning to train the base encoder. Second, to better preserve the identity of
the input image, we introduce a refining encoder to refine the latent code and
add finer details to the output image. Importantly note that the novelty of

closest latent code lying on the latent manifold and thus the refinement in the

Computed Tomography (SVCT) reconstruction tasks as a self-supervised deep

continuous function of spatial coordinates and train a Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) to learn the function by minimizing loss on the SV sinogram. Benefiting
from the continuous representation provided by NeRF, the high-quality CT image

suppose there is completely no relative motion during the CT acquisition

performance drops for real SVCT imaging with motion. In this work, we propose a
self-calibrating neural field to recover the artifacts-free image from the
rigid motion-corrupted SV sinogram without using any external data.
Specifically, we parametrize the inaccurate projection poses caused by rigid

Carlo integration. In contrast, our prefiltered radiance field extends the

their complexity and diversity in poses and appearances. In this work, we
propose, EVA3D, an unconditional 3D human generative model learned from 2D
image collections only. EVA3D can sample 3D humans with detailed geometry and
render high-quality images (up to 512x256) without bells and whistles (e.g.
super resolution). At the core of EVA3D is a compositional human NeRF
representation, which divides the human body into local parts. Each part is
represented by an individual volume. This compositional representation enables
1) inherent human priors, 2) adaptive allocation of network parameters, 3)
efficient training and rendering. Moreover, to accommodate for the
characteristics of sparse 2D human image collections (e.g. imbalanced pose
distribution), we propose a pose-guided sampling strategy for better GAN
learning. Extensive experiments validate that EVA3D achieves state-of-the-art
3D human generation performance regarding both geometry and texture quality.

set of input images taken from various viewpoints. A well-known limitation of
NeRF methods is their reliance on data: the fewer the viewpoints, the higher
the likelihood of overfitting. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a
novel method to generate geometrically consistent image transitions between
viewpoints using View Morphing. Our VM-NeRF approach requires no prior
knowledge about the scene structure, as View Morphing is based on the
fundamental principles of projective geometry. VM-NeRF tightly integrates this
geometric view generation process during the training procedure of standard
NeRF approaches. Notably, our method significantly improves novel view
synthesis, particularly when only a few views are available. Experimental
evaluation reveals consistent improvement over current methods that handle
sparse viewpoints in NeRF models. We report an increase in PSNR of up to 1.8dB

relies on good geometry information extraction as well as good prior terms to
properly resolve ambiguities between different components. To extract
high-quality geometry information from radiance fields, we re-design a new
ray-casting based method for surface point extraction. To efficiently compute

filter operations on the surface extracted from radiance field. We then employ
two type of auxiliary data structures, namely Gaussian KD-tree and octree, to
support fast querying of surface points and efficient computation of surface

representation from multi-view (MV) images. Yet, it cannot handle multi-scale
(MS) images and camera pose estimation errors, which generally is the case with
multi-view images captured from a day-to-day commodity camera. Although
recently proposed Mip-NeRF could handle multi-scale imaging problems with NeRF,
it cannot handle camera pose estimation error. On the other hand, the newly
proposed BARF can solve the camera pose problem with NeRF but fails if the
images are multi-scale in nature. This paper presents a robust multi-scale
neural radiance fields representation approach to simultaneously overcome both
real-world imaging issues. Our method handles multi-scale imaging effects and
camera-pose estimation problems with NeRF-inspired approaches by leveraging the
fundamentals of scene rigidity. To reduce unpleasant aliasing artifacts due to
multi-scale images in the ray space, we leverage Mip-NeRF multi-scale
representation. For joint estimation of robust camera pose, we propose
graph-neural network-based multiple motion averaging in the neural volume
rendering framework. We demonstrate, with examples, that for an accurate neural
representation of an object from day-to-day acquired multi-view images, it is
crucial to have precise camera-pose estimates. Without considering robustness
measures in the camera pose estimation, modeling for multi-scale aliasing

robustness to 2D image transformations, leaving viewpoint changes in the 3D

real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving), making it imperative to
evaluate viewpoint robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel method called
ViewFool to find adversarial viewpoints that mislead visual recognition models.
By encoding real-world objects as neural radiance fields (NeRF), ViewFool
characterizes a distribution of diverse adversarial viewpoints under an
entropic regularizer, which helps to handle the fluctuations of the real camera
pose and mitigate the reality gap between the real objects and their neural
representations. Experiments validate that the common image classifiers are
extremely vulnerable to the generated adversarial viewpoints, which also
exhibit high cross-model transferability. Based on ViewFool, we introduce
ImageNet-V, a new out-of-distribution dataset for benchmarking viewpoint
robustness of image classifiers. Evaluation results on 40 classifiers with

from a single image, video, or a set of 3D scans, several limitations remain.
Most methods use a holistic representation to jointly model the body and
clothing, which means that the clothing and body cannot be separated for
applications like virtual try-on. Other methods separately model the body and
clothing, but they require training from a large set of 3D clothed human meshes
obtained from 3D/4D scanners or physics simulations. Our insight is that the
body and clothing have different modeling requirements. While the body is well
represented by a mesh-based parametric 3D model, implicit representations and
neural radiance fields are better suited to capturing the large variety in
shape and appearance present in clothing. Building on this insight, we propose
SCARF (Segmented Clothed Avatar Radiance Field), a hybrid model combining a
mesh-based body with a neural radiance field. Integrating the mesh into the
volumetric rendering in combination with a differentiable rasterizer enables us
to optimize SCARF directly from monocular videos, without any 3D supervision.
The hybrid modeling enables SCARF to (i) animate the clothed body avatar by
changing body poses (including hand articulation and facial expressions), (ii)
synthesize novel views of the avatar, and (iii) transfer clothing between
avatars in virtual try-on applications. We demonstrate that SCARF reconstructs

photo-realistic 2D images while capturing decent underlying 3D shapes. A
popular solution is to adopt the generative adversarial network (GAN) and
replace the generator with a 3D renderer, where volume rendering with neural
radiance field (NeRF) is commonly used. Despite the advancement of synthesis
quality, existing methods fail to obtain moderate 3D shapes. We argue that,
considering the two-player game in the formulation of GANs, only making the
generator 3D-aware is not enough. In other words, displacing the generative
mechanism only offers the capability, but not the guarantee, of producing
3D-aware images, because the supervision of the generator primarily comes from
the discriminator. To address this issue, we propose GeoD through learning a
geometry-aware discriminator to improve 3D-aware GANs. Concretely, besides
differentiating real and fake samples from the 2D image space, the
discriminator is additionally asked to derive the geometry information from the
inputs, which is then applied as the guidance of the generator. Such a simple
yet effective design facilitates learning substantially more accurate 3D
shapes. Extensive experiments on various generator architectures and training
datasets verify the superiority of GeoD over state-of-the-art alternatives.
Moreover, our approach is registered as a general framework such that a more

range-dependency of these effects, restoring underwater imagery is a
challenging problem. This impacts downstream perception tasks including depth
estimation and 3D reconstruction. In this paper, we advance state-of-the-art in
neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to enable physics-informed dense depth
estimation and color correction. Our proposed method, WaterNeRF, estimates
parameters of a physics-based model for underwater image formation, leading to
a hybrid data-driven and model-based solution. After determining the scene

capturing and animation. But when involving the neural radiance field (NeRF),
learning a static NeRF in the canonical space is not enough because the
lighting of the body changes when the person moves even though the scene
lighting is constant. Previous methods alleviate the inconsistency of lighting
by learning a per-frame embedding, but this operation does not generalize to
unseen poses. Given that the lighting condition is static in the world space
while the human body is consistent in the canonical space, we propose a
dual-space NeRF that models the scene lighting and the human body with two MLPs
in two separate spaces. To bridge these two spaces, previous methods mostly
rely on the linear blend skinning (LBS) algorithm. However, the blending
weights for LBS of a dynamic neural field are intractable and thus are usually
memorized with another MLP, which does not generalize to novel poses. Although
it is possible to borrow the blending weights of a parametric mesh such as
SMPL, the interpolation operation introduces more artifacts. In this paper, we
propose to use the barycentric mapping, which can directly generalize to unseen

Following this trend, several methods aiming for visual localization (e.g.,
SLAM) have been proposed to estimate distance or density fields using neural
fields. However, it is difficult to achieve high localization performance by
only density fields-based methods such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) since
they do not provide density gradient in most empty regions. On the other hand,
distance field-based methods such as Neural Implicit Surface (NeuS) have
limitations in objects' surface shapes. This paper proposes Neural
Density-Distance Field (NeDDF), a novel 3D representation that reciprocally
constrains the distance and density fields. We extend distance field
formulation to shapes with no explicit boundary surface, such as fur or smoke,
which enable explicit conversion from distance field to density field.
Consistent distance and density fields realized by explicit conversion enable
both robustness to initial values and high-quality registration. Furthermore,
the consistency between fields allows fast convergence from sparse point
clouds. Experiments show that NeDDF can achieve high localization performance

the rays. Directly applying a standard transformer on this seq2seq formulation
has two limitations. First, the standard attention cannot successfully fit the
volumetric rendering procedure, and therefore high-frequency components are
missing in the synthesized views. Second, applying global attention to all rays
and pixels is extremely inefficient. Inspired by the neural radiance field
(NeRF), we propose the NeRF attention (NeRFA) to address the above problems. On
the one hand, NeRFA considers the volumetric rendering equation as a soft
feature modulation procedure. In this way, the feature modulation enhances the
transformers with the NeRF-like inductive bias. On the other hand, NeRFA
performs multi-stage attention to reduce the computational overhead.
Furthermore, the NeRFA model adopts the ray and pixel transformers to learn the
interactions between rays and pixels. NeRFA demonstrates superior performance
over NeRF and NerFormer on four datasets: DeepVoxels, Blender, LLFF, and CO3D.

architecture that reconstructs Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and learns to
renders novel views on the fly from source views. While prior works on NeRFs
optimize a scene representation by inverting a handcrafted rendering equation,
GNT achieves neural representation and rendering that generalizes across scenes
using transformers at two stages. (1) The view transformer leverages multi-view
geometry as an inductive bias for attention-based scene representation, and
predicts coordinate-aligned features by aggregating information from epipolar
lines on the neighboring views. (2) The ray transformer renders novel views
using attention to decode the features from the view transformer along the
sampled points during ray marching. Our experiments demonstrate that when
optimized on a single scene, GNT can successfully reconstruct NeRF without an
explicit rendering formula due to the learned ray renderer. When trained on
multiple scenes, GNT consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance when
transferring to unseen scenes and outperform all other methods by ~10% on
average. Our analysis of the learned attention maps to infer depth and

and image-guided robotic surgery automation. Previous works on this task mainly
rely on SLAM-based approaches, which struggle to handle complex surgical
scenes. Inspired by recent progress in neural rendering, we present a novel
framework for deformable tissue reconstruction from binocular captures in
robotic surgery under the single-viewpoint setting. Our framework adopts
dynamic neural radiance fields to represent deformable surgical scenes in MLPs
and optimize shapes and deformations in a learning-based manner. In addition to
non-rigid deformations, tool occlusion and poor 3D clues from a single
viewpoint are also particular challenges in soft tissue reconstruction. To
overcome these difficulties, we present a series of strategies of tool
mask-guided ray casting, stereo depth-cueing ray marching and stereo
depth-supervised optimization. With experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery
videos, our method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art
reconstruction method for handling various complex non-rigid deformations. To
our best knowledge, this is the first work leveraging neural rendering for
surgical scene 3D reconstruction with remarkable potential demonstrated. Code

event cameras can measure subtle brightness changes in high frame rates, the
measurements in low lighting or extreme motion suffer from significant domain
discrepancy with complex noise. As a result, the performance of event-based
vision tasks does not transfer to challenging environments, where the event
cameras are expected to thrive over normal cameras. We find that the multi-view
consistency of NeRF provides a powerful self-supervision signal for eliminating
the spurious measurements and extracting the consistent underlying structure
despite highly noisy input. Instead of posed images of the original NeRF, the
input to Ev-NeRF is the event measurements accompanied by the movements of the
sensors. Using the loss function that reflects the measurement model of the
sensor, Ev-NeRF creates an integrated neural volume that summarizes the
unstructured and sparse data points captured for about 2-4 seconds. The
generated neural volume can also produce intensity images from novel views with

scenes to dynamic human motion. However, the increased resolution and
model-free nature of such neural fields come at the cost of high training times

by using complementary data structures yet these methods are ill-suited for
dynamic scenes and often increase memory consumption. Little has been done to
reduce the resources required at training time. We propose a method to exploit
the redundancy of NeRF's sample-based computations by partially sharing
evaluations across neighboring sample points. Our UNeRF architecture is
inspired by the UNet, where spatial resolution is reduced in the middle of the
network and information is shared between adjacent samples. Although this
change violates the strict and conscious separation of view-dependent
appearance and view-independent density estimation in the NeRF method, we show
that it improves novel view synthesis. We also introduce an alternative
subsampling strategy which shares computation while minimizing any violation of
view invariance. UNeRF is a plug-in module for the original NeRF network. Our
major contributions include reduction of the memory footprint, improved

either assume knowledge of obstacles and lighting, or only focus on simple
fluid scenes without obstacles or complex lighting, and thus are unsuitable for
real-world scenes with unknown lighting or arbitrary obstacles. We present the
first method to reconstruct dynamic fluid by leveraging the governing physics

With a hybrid architecture that separates static and dynamic contents, fluid
interactions with static obstacles are reconstructed for the first time without

radiance fields with physics-informed deep learning, our method benefits from
the supervision of images and physical priors. To achieve robust optimization

fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Neural approaches such
as NeRF have achieved photorealistic results on novel view synthesis, but they
require known camera poses. Solving this problem with unknown camera poses is
highly challenging as it requires joint optimization over shape, radiance, and
pose. This problem is exacerbated when the input images are captured in the
wild with varying backgrounds and illuminations. Standard pose estimation
techniques fail in such image collections in the wild due to very few estimated
correspondences across images. Furthermore, NeRF cannot relight a scene under
any illumination, as it operates on radiance (the product of reflectance and
illumination). We propose a joint optimization framework to estimate the shape,
BRDF, and per-image camera pose and illumination. Our method works on
in-the-wild online image collections of an object and produces relightable 3D
assets for several use-cases such as AR/VR. To our knowledge, our method is the
first to tackle this severely unconstrained task with minimal user interaction.

a practical and useful technique for many real-world applications. Recently,
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a rendering technique that uses neural networks
to approximate classical ray tracing, have been considered as one of the
promising approaches for synthesizing novel views from a sparse set of images.
We find that NeRF can render new views while maintaining geometric consistency,
but it does not properly maintain skin details, such as moles and pores. These
details are important particularly for faces because when we look at an image
of a face, we are much more sensitive to details than when we look at other
objects. On the other hand, 3D Morpable Models (3DMMs) based on traditional
meshes and textures can perform well in terms of skin detail despite that it
has less precise geometry and cannot cover the head and the entire scene with
background. Based on these observations, we propose a method to use both NeRF
and 3DMM to synthesize a high-fidelity novel view of a scene with a face. Our
method learns a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to mix a NeRF-synthesized
image and a 3DMM-rendered image and produces a photorealistic scene with a face
preserving the skin details. Experiments with various real-world scenes
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code will be available on

Fields (NeRF) suffer from slow convergence (i.e., model training time measured

learning dynamic radiance fields. The core of DeVRF is to model both the 3D
canonical space and 4D deformation field of a dynamic, non-rigid scene with
explicit and discrete voxel-based representations. However, it is quite
challenging to train such a representation which has a large number of model
parameters, often resulting in overfitting issues. To overcome this challenge,
we devise a novel static-to-dynamic learning paradigm together with a new data
capture setup that is convenient to deploy in practice. This paradigm unlocks
efficient learning of deformable radiance fields via utilizing the 3D
volumetric canonical space learnt from multi-view static images to ease the

the SVD algorithm, we propose a rank-residual learning strategy to encourage
the preservation of primary information in lower ranks. The model size can then
be dynamically adjusted by rank truncation to control the levels of detail,
achieving near-optimal compression without extra optimization. Furthermore,
different models can be arbitrarily transformed and composed into one scene by
concatenating along the rank dimension. The growth of storage cost can also be
mitigated by compressing the unimportant objects in the composed scene. We

arbitrary novel views following a given set of style examples, while ensuring
consistency when rendered from different views. Directly applying methods for
image or video stylization to 3D scenes cannot achieve such consistency. Thanks
to recently proposed neural radiance fields (NeRF), we are able to represent a

effectively achieved by stylizing the corresponding NeRF. However, there is a
significant domain gap between style examples which are 2D images and NeRF

propose a novel mutual learning framework for 3D scene stylization that
combines a 2D image stylization network and NeRF to fuse the stylization
ability of 2D stylization network with the 3D consistency of NeRF. We first
pre-train a standard NeRF of the 3D scene to be stylized and replace its color

followed by distilling the prior knowledge of spatial consistency from NeRF to
the 2D stylization network through an introduced consistency loss. We also

free-viewpoint images of arbitrary human performers, only requiring a sparse
number of camera views as inputs and skirting per-case fine-tuning. The large
variation of geometry and appearance, caused by articulated body poses, shapes

challenges, we present a simple yet powerful framework, named Generalizable
Neural Performer (GNR), that learns a generalizable and robust neural body
representation over various geometry and appearance. Specifically, we compress
the light fields for novel view human rendering as conditional implicit neural
radiance fields from both geometry and appearance aspects. We first introduce
an Implicit Geometric Body Embedding strategy to enhance the robustness based
on both parametric 3D human body model and multi-view images hints. We further

are scene-specific and lack a 3D scene representation, classical editing such

combining NeRF-based scenes has not been demonstrated. With the aim of
obtaining interpretable and controllable scene representations, our model
couples learnt scene-specific feature volumes with a scene agnostic neural

rendering from scene-specific geometry and appearance. We can generalize to
novel scenes by optimizing only the scene-specific 3D feature representation,
while keeping the parameters of the rendering network fixed. The rendering
function learnt during the initial training stage can thus be easily applied to
new scenes, making our approach more flexible. More importantly, since the
feature volumes are independent of the rendering model, we can manipulate and
combine scenes by editing their corresponding feature volumes. The edited
volume can then be plugged into the rendering model to synthesize high-quality

hidden geometry. We propose a graphics-inspired differentiable approach to
render accurate shadows with volumetric rendering, predicting a shadow map that

we show that neural rendering can localize the object and estimate coarse

requires generating photo-realistic individual talking heads but also demands
the listener to respond to the speaker. In this paper, we propose a novel

utilizing multiplane technology. Still, they are either time-consuming or
memory-consuming. This paper proposes a novel thin-lens-imaging-based NeRF
framework that can directly render various 3D defocus effects, dubbed NeRFocus.
Unlike the pinhole, the thin lens refracts rays of a scene point, so its
imaging on the sensor plane is scattered as a circle of confusion (CoC). A
direct solution sampling enough rays to approximate this process is
computationally expensive. Instead, we propose to inverse the thin lens imaging
to explicitly model the beam path for each point on the sensor plane and
generalize this paradigm to the beam path of each pixel, then use the
frustum-based volume rendering to render each pixel's beam path. We further
design an efficient probabilistic training (p-training) strategy to simplify
the training process vastly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
NeRFocus can achieve various 3D defocus effects with adjustable camera pose,
focus distance, and aperture size. Existing NeRF can be regarded as our special
case by setting aperture size as zero to render large depth-of-field images.

architectures for NeRF, ICARUS executes the complete NeRF pipeline using
dedicated plenoptic cores (PLCore) consisting of a positional encoding unit

pixel colors without any intermediate data going off-chip for temporary storage

individual NeRFs from which the scene can be reconstructed. Based on those
latent vectors, we train a graph neural network dynamics model in the latent

approach is that the latent vectors are forced to encode 3D information through
the NeRF decoder, which enables us to incorporate structural priors in learning
the dynamics models, making long-term predictions more stable compared to

instance, live interactions with virtual characters in virtual environments,

technique called neural volumetric video or NeuVV to support immersive,
interactive, and spatial-temporal rendering of volumetric video contents with
photo-realism and in real-time. The core of NeuVV is to efficiently encode a
dynamic neural radiance field (NeRF) into renderable and editable primitives.
We introduce two types of factorization schemes: a hyper-spherical harmonics
(HH) decomposition for modeling smooth color variations over space and time and
a learnable basis representation for modeling abrupt density and color changes
caused by motion. NeuVV factorization can be integrated into a Video Octree
(VOctree) analogous to PlenOctree to significantly accelerate training while
reducing memory overhead. Real-time NeuVV rendering further enables a class of
immersive content editing tools. Specifically, NeuVV treats each VOctree as a
primitive and implements volume-based depth ordering and alpha blending to
realize spatial-temporal compositions for content re-purposing. For example, we
demonstrate positioning varied manifestations of the same performance at
different 3D locations with different timing, adjusting color/texture of the

diverse sets of objects in the wild. We present BANMo, a method that requires
neither a specialized sensor nor a pre-defined template shape. BANMo builds
high-fidelity, articulated 3D models (including shape and animatable skinning
weights) from many monocular casual videos in a differentiable rendering
framework. While the use of many videos provides more coverage of camera views
and object articulations, they introduce significant challenges in establishing
correspondence across scenes with different backgrounds, illumination
conditions, etc. Our key insight is to merge three schools of thought; (1)
classic deformable shape models that make use of articulated bones and blend
skinning, (2) volumetric neural radiance fields (NeRFs) that are amenable to
gradient-based optimization, and (3) canonical embeddings that generate
correspondences between pixels and an articulated model. We introduce neural
blend skinning models that allow for differentiable and invertible articulated
deformations. When combined with canonical embeddings, such models allow us to
establish dense correspondences across videos that can be self-supervised with
cycle consistency. On real and synthetic datasets, BANMo shows higher-fidelity
3D reconstructions than prior works for humans and animals, with the ability to
render realistic images from novel viewpoints and poses. Project webpage:

physical world yet remains challenging. Recent attempts equip a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) with a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which maps 3D
coordinates to pixel values, as a 3D prior. However, the implicit function in
NeRF has a very local receptive field, making the generator hard to become
aware of the global structure. Meanwhile, NeRF is built on volume rendering
which can be too costly to produce high-resolution results, increasing the
optimization difficulty. To alleviate these two problems, we propose a novel
framework, termed as VolumeGAN, for high-fidelity 3D-aware image synthesis,
through explicitly learning a structural representation and a textural
representation. We first learn a feature volume to represent the underlying
structure, which is then converted to a feature field using a NeRF-like model.
The feature field is further accumulated into a 2D feature map as the textural
representation, followed by a neural renderer for appearance synthesis. Such a
design enables independent control of the shape and the appearance. Extensive
experiments on a wide range of datasets show that our approach achieves
sufficiently higher image quality and better 3D control than the previous

from large-scale visual captures spanning buildings or even multiple city
blocks collected primarily from drones. In contrast to single object scenes (on
which NeRFs are traditionally evaluated), our scale poses multiple challenges
including (1) the need to model thousands of images with varying lighting
conditions, each of which capture only a small subset of the scene, (2)
prohibitively large model capacities that make it infeasible to train on a
single GPU, and (3) significant challenges for fast rendering that would enable
interactive fly-throughs.
  To address these challenges, we begin by analyzing visibility statistics for
large-scale scenes, motivating a sparse network structure where parameters are
specialized to different regions of the scene. We introduce a simple geometric
clustering algorithm for data parallelism that partitions training images (or
rather pixels) into different NeRF submodules that can be trained in parallel.
  We evaluate our approach on existing datasets (Quad 6k and UrbanScene3D) as
well as against our own drone footage, improving training speed by 3x and PSNR

Rendering (HVTR), which synthesizes virtual human avatars from arbitrary poses
efficiently and at high quality. First, we learn to encode articulated human
motions on a dense UV manifold of the human body surface. To handle complicated
motions (e.g., self-occlusions), we then leverage the encoded information on
the UV manifold to construct a 3D volumetric representation based on a dynamic
pose-conditioned neural radiance field. While this allows us to represent 3D
geometry with changing topology, volumetric rendering is computationally heavy.
Hence we employ only a rough volumetric representation using a pose-conditioned
downsampled neural radiance field (PD-NeRF), which we can render efficiently at
low resolutions. In addition, we learn 2D textural features that are fused with
rendered volumetric features in image space. The key advantage of our approach
is that we can then convert the fused features into a high-resolution,
high-quality avatar by a fast GAN-based textural renderer. We demonstrate that
hybrid rendering enables HVTR to handle complicated motions, render

by training neural radiance field (NeRF) generators on unstructured 2D images,

critical reason is that the high memory and computation cost of volumetric
representation learning greatly restricts the number of point samples for
radiance integration during training. Deficient sampling not only limits the
expressive power of the generator to handle fine details but also impedes
effective GAN training due to the noise caused by unstable Monte Carlo
sampling. We propose a novel approach that regulates point sampling and
radiance field learning on 2D manifolds, embodied as a set of learned implicit

modeling 3D objects and controlled scenes, usually under a single scale. In
this work, we focus on multi-scale cases where large changes in imagery are
observed at drastically different scales. This scenario vastly exists in
real-world 3D environments, such as city scenes, with views ranging from
satellite level that captures the overview of a city, to ground level imagery
showing complex details of an architecture; and can also be commonly identified
in landscape and delicate minecraft 3D models. The wide span of viewing

biases it towards compromised results. To address these issues, we introduce
BungeeNeRF, a progressive neural radiance field that achieves level-of-detail

accommodate the emerging details in the increasingly closer views. The strategy
progressively activates high-frequency channels in NeRF's positional encoding

a unified framework that allows manipulating NeRF in a user-friendly way, using
either a short text prompt or an exemplar image. Specifically, to combine the
novel view synthesis capability of NeRF and the controllable manipulation
ability of latent representations from generative models, we introduce a
disentangled conditional NeRF architecture that allows individual control over
both shape and appearance. This is achieved by performing the shape
conditioning via applying a learned deformation field to the positional
encoding and deferring color conditioning to the volumetric rendering stage. To
bridge this disentangled latent representation to the CLIP embedding, we design
two code mappers that take a CLIP embedding as input and update the latent
codes to reflect the targeted editing. The mappers are trained with a
CLIP-based matching loss to ensure the manipulation accuracy. Furthermore, we
propose an inverse optimization method that accurately projects an input image
to the latent codes for manipulation to enable editing on real images. We

free-viewpoint videos. Some recent works equip neural radiance fields with
image encoders, enabling them to generalize across scenes. When processing
dynamic scenes, they can simply treat each video frame as an individual scene
and perform novel view synthesis to generate free-viewpoint videos. However,
their rendering process is slow and cannot support interactive applications. A
major factor is that they sample lots of points in empty space when inferring
radiance fields. We propose a novel scene representation, called ENeRF, for the
fast creation of interactive free-viewpoint videos. Specifically, given
multi-view images at one frame, we first build the cascade cost volume to
predict the coarse geometry of the scene. The coarse geometry allows us to
sample few points near the scene surface, thereby significantly improving the
rendering speed. This process is fully differentiable, enabling us to jointly
learn the depth prediction and radiance field networks from RGB images.

performance while being at least 60 times faster than previous generalizable

However, they usually struggle to generate high-quality images representing

Semantic-Guided Generative Model (3D-SGAN) for human image synthesis, which
combines a GNeRF with a texture generator. The former learns an implicit 3D

reconstruction quality. To address this problem, We propose Deblur-NeRF, the
first method that can recover a sharp NeRF from blurry input. We adopt an
analysis-by-synthesis approach that reconstructs blurry views by simulating the
blurring process, thus making NeRF robust to blurry inputs. The core of this

spatially-varying blur kernels by deforming a canonical sparse kernel at each

fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. Neural approaches such as
NeRF have achieved remarkable success in view synthesis, but do not explicitly
perform decomposition and instead operate exclusively on radiance (the product
of reflectance and illumination). Extensions to NeRF, such as NeRD, can perform
decomposition but struggle to accurately recover detailed illumination, thereby
significantly limiting realism. We propose a novel reflectance decomposition
network that can estimate shape, BRDF, and per-image illumination given a set
of object images captured under varying illumination. Our key technique is a
novel illumination integration network called Neural-PIL that replaces a costly
illumination integral operation in the rendering with a simple network query.
In addition, we also learn deep low-dimensional priors on BRDF and illumination
representations using novel smooth manifold auto-encoders. Our decompositions
can result in considerably better BRDF and light estimates enabling more
accurate novel view-synthesis and relighting compared to prior art. Project

introduce a surface analog of such implicit models called Neural Reflectance
Surfaces (NeRS). NeRS learns a neural shape representation of a closed surface

for immersive visual effects and VR/AR experience. Recent neural advances still
lack the controllable and interactive bullet-time design ability for human
free-viewpoint rendering, especially under the real-time, dynamic and general
setting for our trajectory-aware task. To fill this gap, in this paper we
propose a neural interactive bullet-time generator (iButter) for
photo-realistic human free-viewpoint rendering from dense RGB streams, which
enables flexible and interactive design for human bullet-time visual effects.
Our iButter approach consists of a real-time preview and design stage as well
as a trajectory-aware refinement stage. During preview, we propose an
interactive bullet-time design approach by extending the NeRF rendering to a
real-time and dynamic setting and getting rid of the tedious per-scene
training. To this end, our bullet-time design stage utilizes a hybrid training
set, light-weight network design and an efficient silhouette-based sampling
strategy. During refinement, we introduce an efficient trajectory-aware scheme
within 20 minutes, which jointly encodes the spatial, temporal consistency and
semantic cues along the designed trajectory, achieving photo-realistic
bullet-time viewing experience of human activities. Extensive experiments

we impose a spatial prior brought by 3DMM fitting to guide the network to learn

occupancy values have enabled high-fidelity implicit representations of object
shape. This paper develops a new shape model that allows synthesizing novel

categories of shapes and complete or interpolate across shapes from partial
input data. Unlike an SDF, which measures distance to the nearest surface in
any direction, an SDDF measures distance in a given direction. This allows
training an SDDF model without 3D shape supervision, using only distance
measurements, readily available from depth camera or Lidar sensors. Our model
also removes post-processing steps like surface extraction or rendering by
directly predicting distance at arbitrary locations and viewing directions.
Unlike deep view-synthesis techniques, such as Neural Radiance Fields, which
train high-capacity black-box models, our model encodes by construction the

incorrect geometries when given an insufficient number of input views. One
potential reason is that standard volumetric rendering does not enforce the
constraint that most of a scene's geometry consist of empty space and opaque
surfaces. We formalize the above assumption through DS-NeRF (Depth-supervised
Neural Radiance Fields), a loss for learning radiance fields that takes
advantage of readily-available depth supervision. We leverage the fact that
current NeRF pipelines require images with known camera poses that are
typically estimated by running structure-from-motion (SFM). Crucially, SFM also
produces sparse 3D points that can be used as ""free"" depth supervision during
training: we add a loss to encourage the distribution of a ray's terminating
depth matches a given 3D keypoint, incorporating depth uncertainty. DS-NeRF can
render better images given fewer training views while training 2-3x faster.
Further, we show that our loss is compatible with other recently proposed NeRF

through the use of a learned deformation field mapping from coordinates in each

deformation-based approaches struggle to model changes in topology, as
topological changes require a discontinuity in the deformation field, but these
deformation fields are necessarily continuous. We address this limitation by
lifting NeRFs into a higher dimensional space, and by representing the 5D

this ""hyper-space"". Our method is inspired by level set methods, which model
the evolution of surfaces as slices through a higher dimensional surface. We
evaluate our method on two tasks: (i) interpolating smoothly between ""moments"",

visual plausibility, and (ii) novel-view synthesis at fixed moments. We show

a neural scene representation with robustness of optimization, even for highly
complex objects. However, extracting high-quality surfaces from this learned

constraints in the representation. In NeuS, we propose to represent a surface

volume rendering method to train a neural SDF representation. We observe that
the conventional volume rendering method causes inherent geometric errors (i.e.
bias) for surface reconstruction, and therefore propose a new formulation that
is free of bias in the first order of approximation, thus leading to more
accurate surface reconstruction even without the mask supervision. Experiments

In particular, our implicit representation model disentangles the scene into

we compare and evaluate the potential of NeRF and GRAF to render novel views

Storage of such a 3D scene can be done in two ways; (1) storing 2D images taken
from the 3D scene that can reconstruct the scene back through interpolations,
or (2) storing a representation of the 3D scene itself that already encodes
views from all directions. So far, traditional 3D compression methods have
focused on the first type of storage and compressed the original 2D images with
image compression techniques. With this approach, the user first decodes the
stored 2D images and then renders the 3D scene. However, this separated
procedure is inefficient since a large amount of 2D images have to be stored.
In this work, we take a different approach and compress a functional
representation of 3D scenes. In particular, we introduce a method to compress
3D scenes by compressing the neural networks that represent the scenes as
neural radiance fields. Our method provides more efficient storage of 3D scenes
since it does not store 2D images -- which are redundant when we render the
scene from the neural functional representation.";Berivan Isik;http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03120v1;cs.CV;Stanford CS 231A Final Project, 2021. WiCV at CVPR 2021;

model from a multi-view video. Some recent works have proposed to decompose a
non-rigidly deforming scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of
deformation fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space,
thereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they
represent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field,
which makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these
representations cannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we
introduce neural blend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based
on the skeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D human
skeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observation
correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can
regularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blend
weight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate new
deformation fields to animate the human model. Experiments show that our

but recent neural advances still lack the editing ability to manipulate the
visual perception for large dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, in this paper we
propose the first approach for editable photo-realistic free-viewpoint video
generation for large-scale dynamic scenes using only sparse 16 cameras. The
core of our approach is a new layered neural representation, where each dynamic
entity including the environment itself is formulated into a space-time
coherent neural layered radiance representation called ST-NeRF. Such layered
representation supports fully perception and realistic manipulation of the
dynamic scene whilst still supporting a free viewing experience in a wide
range. In our ST-NeRF, the dynamic entity/layer is represented as continuous
functions, which achieves the disentanglement of location, deformation as well
as the appearance of the dynamic entity in a continuous and self-supervised
manner. We propose a scene parsing 4D label map tracking to disentangle the
spatial information explicitly, and a continuous deform module to disentangle
the temporal motion implicitly. An object-aware volume rendering scheme is
further introduced for the re-assembling of all the neural layers. We adopt a
novel layered loss and motion-aware ray sampling strategy to enable efficient
training for a large dynamic scene with multiple performers, Our framework
further enables a variety of editing functions, i.e., manipulating the scale

requires no labels or shape priors: it is self-supervised by an image
reconstruction loss. To accommodate for changing light source conditions both
from a directional light source (the Sun) and a diffuse light source (the sky),
we extend the NeRF approach in two ways. First, direct illumination from the
Sun is modeled via a local light source visibility field. Second, indirect
illumination from a diffuse light source is learned as a non-local color field
as a function of the position of the Sun. Quantitatively, the combination of
these factors reduces the altitude and color errors in shaded areas, compared

approach that is trained end-to-end, generalizes to new scenes, and requires
only sparse views at test time. The core idea is a neural architecture inspired
by classical multi-view stereo methods, which estimates surface points by
finding similar image regions in stereo images. In SRF, we predict color and
density for each 3D point given an encoding of its stereo correspondence in the
input images. The encoding is implicitly learned by an ensemble of pair-wise
similarities -- emulating classical stereo. Experiments show that SRF learns
structure instead of overfitting on a scene. We train on multiple scenes of the

evaluate its effectiveness and generalizability. Our approach can generalize
across scenes (even indoor scenes, completely different from our training
scenes of objects) and generate realistic view synthesis results using only
three input images, significantly outperforming concurrent works on
generalizable radiance field reconstruction. Moreover, if dense images are

using PlenOctrees, an octree-based 3D representation which supports
view-dependent effects. Our method can render 800x800 images at more than 150
FPS, which is over 3000 times faster than conventional NeRFs. We do so without
sacrificing quality while preserving the ability of NeRFs to perform
free-viewpoint rendering of scenes with arbitrary geometry and view-dependent
effects. Real-time performance is achieved by pre-tabulating the NeRF into a
PlenOctree. In order to preserve view-dependent effects such as specularities,
we factorize the appearance via closed-form spherical basis functions.
Specifically, we show that it is possible to train NeRFs to predict a spherical
harmonic representation of radiance, removing the viewing direction as an input
to the neural network. Furthermore, we show that PlenOctrees can be directly
optimized to further minimize the reconstruction loss, which leads to equal or
better quality compared to competing methods. Moreover, this octree
optimization step can be used to reduce the training time, as we no longer need
to wait for the NeRF training to converge fully. Our real-time neural rendering
approach may potentially enable new applications such as 6-DOF industrial and

NeRF, shows that there is immense potential for implicitly storing high-quality
scene and lighting information in compact neural networks. However, one major
limitation preventing the use of NeRF in real-time rendering applications is
the prohibitive computational cost of excessive network evaluations along each
view ray, requiring dozens of petaFLOPS. In this work, we bring compact neural
representations closer to practical rendering of synthetic content in real-time
applications, such as games and virtual reality. We show that the number of
samples required for each view ray can be significantly reduced when samples
are placed around surfaces in the scene without compromising image quality. To
this end, we propose a depth oracle network that predicts ray sample locations
for each view ray with a single network evaluation. We show that using a
classification network around logarithmically discretized and spherically
warped depth values is essential to encode surface locations rather than
directly estimating depth. The combination of these techniques leads to DONeRF,
our compact dual network design with a depth oracle network as its first step
and a locally sampled shading network for ray accumulation. With DONeRF, we
reduce the inference costs by up to 48x compared to NeRF when conditioning on

of objects. Our work builds upon neural radiance fields (NeRFs), which
implicitly model the volumetric density and directionally-emitted radiance of a

and are closely tied to specific imaging conditions. This property makes NeRFs
hard to generalize to new scenarios, including new lighting or new arrangements
of objects. Instead of learning a scene radiance field as a NeRF does, we
propose to learn object-centric neural scattering functions (OSFs), a
representation that models per-object light transport implicitly using a
lighting- and view-dependent neural network. This enables rendering scenes even
when objects or lights move, without retraining. Combined with a volumetric
path tracing procedure, our framework is capable of rendering both intra- and
inter-object light transport effects including occlusions, specularities,

""inverting"" a Neural RadianceField (NeRF). NeRFs have been shown to be
remarkably effective for the task of view synthesis - synthesizing
photorealistic novel views of real-world scenes or objects. In this work, we
investigate whether we can apply analysis-by-synthesis via NeRF for mesh-free,
RGB-only 6DoF pose estimation - given an image, find the translation and
rotation of a camera relative to a 3D object or scene. Our method assumes that
no object mesh models are available during either training or test time.
Starting from an initial pose estimate, we use gradient descent to minimize the
residual between pixels rendered from a NeRF and pixels in an observed image.
In our experiments, we first study 1) how to sample rays during pose refinement
for iNeRF to collect informative gradients and 2) how different batch sizes of
rays affect iNeRF on a synthetic dataset. We then show that for complex
real-world scenes from the LLFF dataset, iNeRF can improve NeRF by estimating
the camera poses of novel images and using these images as additional training
data for NeRF. Finally, we show iNeRF can perform category-level object pose

scene representation conditioned on one or few input images. The existing
approach for constructing neural radiance fields involves optimizing the
representation to every scene independently, requiring many calibrated views
and significant compute time. We take a step towards resolving these
shortcomings by introducing an architecture that conditions a NeRF on image
inputs in a fully convolutional manner. This allows the network to be trained
across multiple scenes to learn a scene prior, enabling it to perform novel
view synthesis in a feed-forward manner from a sparse set of views (as few as
one). Leveraging the volume rendering approach of NeRF, our model can be
trained directly from images with no explicit 3D supervision. We conduct
extensive experiments on ShapeNet benchmarks for single image novel view
synthesis tasks with held-out objects as well as entire unseen categories. We
further demonstrate the flexibility of pixelNeRF by demonstrating it on

reasoning have arisen as one of the most promising approaches for synthesizing
novel views of a scene from a sparse set of images. Among these, stands out the
Neural radiance fields (NeRF), which trains a deep network to map 5D input
coordinates (representing spatial location and viewing direction) into a volume
density and view-dependent emitted radiance. However, despite achieving an
unprecedented level of photorealism on the generated images, NeRF is only
applicable to static scenes, where the same spatial location can be queried
from different images. In this paper we introduce D-NeRF, a method that extends
neural radiance fields to a dynamic domain, allowing to reconstruct and render
novel images of objects under rigid and non-rigid motions from a \emph{single}
camera moving around the scene. For this purpose we consider time as an
additional input to the system, and split the learning process in two main
stages: one that encodes the scene into a canonical space and another that maps
this canonical representation into the deformed scene at a particular time.
Both mappings are simultaneously learned using fully-connected networks. Once
the networks are trained, D-NeRF can render novel images, controlling both the
camera view and the time variable, and thus, the object movement. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on scenes with objects under
rigid, articulated and non-rigid motions. Code, model weights and the dynamic

principles from geometry processing and physical simulation to NeRF-like

render novel views of a 3D scene with quality that fools the human eye. Yet,
generating these images is very computationally intensive, limiting their
applicability in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a technique
based on spatial decomposition capable of mitigating this issue. Our key
observation is that there are diminishing returns in employing larger (deeper
and/or wider) networks. Hence, we propose to spatially decompose a scene and
dedicate smaller networks for each decomposed part. When working together,
these networks can render the whole scene. This allows us near-constant
inference time regardless of the number of decomposed parts. Moreover, we show
that a Voronoi spatial decomposition is preferable for this purpose, as it is
provably compatible with the Painter's Algorithm for efficient and GPU-friendly
rendering. Our experiments show that for real-world scenes, our method provides
up to 3x more efficient inference than NeRF (with the same rendering quality),

computer graphics techniques is challenging, because it requires the difficult
step of capturing detailed appearance and geometry models. Recent studies have
demonstrated promising results by learning scene representations that
implicitly encode both geometry and appearance without 3D supervision. However,
existing approaches in practice often show blurry renderings caused by the
limited network capacity or the difficulty in finding accurate intersections of
camera rays with the scene geometry. Synthesizing high-resolution imagery from
these representations often requires time-consuming optical ray marching. In
this work, we introduce Neural Sparse Voxel Fields (NSVF), a new neural scene
representation for fast and high-quality free-viewpoint rendering. NSVF defines
a set of voxel-bounded implicit fields organized in a sparse voxel octree to
model local properties in each cell. We progressively learn the underlying
voxel structures with a differentiable ray-marching operation from only a set
of posed RGB images. With the sparse voxel octree structure, rendering novel
views can be accelerated by skipping the voxels containing no relevant scene
content. Our method is typically over 10 times faster than the state-of-the-art
(namely, NeRF(Mildenhall et al., 2020)) at inference time while achieving
higher quality results. Furthermore, by utilizing an explicit sparse voxel
representation, our method can easily be applied to scene editing and scene
composition. We also demonstrate several challenging tasks, including
multi-scene learning, free-viewpoint rendering of a moving human, and
large-scale scene rendering. Code and data are available at our website:

involves redundancy in data representation. Mathematically this may be achieved
by redundancy through the use of frames. One way to measure the robustness of a
frame against erasures is to examine the worst case condition number of the
frame with a certain number of vectors erased from the frame. The term {\em
numerically erasure-robust frames (NERFs)} was introduced in \cite{FicMix12} to
give a more precise characterization of erasure robustness of frames. In the
paper the authors established that random frames whose entries are drawn
independently from the standard normal distribution can be robust against up to
approximately 15\% erasures, and asked whether there exist frames that are
robust against erasures of more than 50\%. In this paper we show that with very
high probability random frames are, independent of the dimension, robust
against any amount of erasures as long as the number of remaining vectors is at
least $1+\delta$ times the dimension for some $\delta_0>0$. This is the best
possible result, and it also implies that the proportion of erasures can
arbitrarily close to 1 while still maintaining robustness. Our result depends

construct matrices with the restricted isometry property (RIP) whose
performance rivals those generated using random matrix theory. In short, RIP
involves estimating the singular values of a combinatorially large number of
submatrices, seemingly requiring an enormous amount of computation in even
low-dimensional examples. In this paper, we consider a similar problem
involving submatrix singular value estimation, namely the problem of explicitly
constructing numerically erasure robust frames (NERFs). Such frames are the
latest invention in a long line of research concerning the design of linear
encoders that are robust against data loss. We begin by focusing on a subtle
difference between the definition of a NERF and that of an RIP matrix, one that
allows us to introduce a new computational trick for quickly estimating NERF
bounds. In short, we estimate these bounds by evaluating the frame analysis
operator at every point of an epsilon-net for the unit sphere. We then borrow
ideas from the theory of group frames to construct explicit frames and
epsilon-nets with such high degrees of symmetry that the requisite number of
operator evaluations is greatly reduced. We conclude with numerical results,
using these new ideas to quickly produce decent estimates of NERF bounds which
would otherwise take an eternity. Though the more important RIP problem remains
