**Abstract**: Recent advancements in 2D/3D generative techniques have facilitated the
generation of dynamic 3D objects from monocular videos. Previous methods mainly
rely on the implicit neural radiance fields (NeRF) or explicit Gaussian
Splatting as the underlying representation, and struggle to achieve
satisfactory spatial-temporal consistency and surface appearance. Drawing
inspiration from modern 3D animation pipelines, we introduce DreamMesh4D, a
novel framework combining mesh representation with geometric skinning technique
to generate high-quality 4D object from a monocular video. Instead of utilizing
classical texture map for appearance, we bind Gaussian splats to triangle face
of mesh for differentiable optimization of both the texture and mesh vertices.
In particular, DreamMesh4D begins with a coarse mesh obtained through an
image-to-3D generation procedure. Sparse points are then uniformly sampled
across the mesh surface, and are used to build a deformation graph to drive the
motion of the 3D object for the sake of computational efficiency and providing
additional constraint. For each step, transformations of sparse control points
are predicted using a deformation network, and the mesh vertices as well as the
surface Gaussians are deformed via a novel geometric skinning algorithm, which
is a hybrid approach combining LBS (linear blending skinning) and DQS
(dual-quaternion skinning), mitigating drawbacks associated with both
approaches. The static surface Gaussians and mesh vertices as well as the
deformation network are learned via reference view photometric loss, score
distillation loss as well as other regularizers in a two-stage manner.
Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of our method.
Furthermore, our method is compatible with modern graphic pipelines, showcasing
its potential in the 3D gaming and film industry.

**Abstract**: Talking face generation (TFG) aims to animate a target identity's face to
create realistic talking videos. Personalized TFG is a variant that emphasizes
the perceptual identity similarity of the synthesized result (from the
perspective of appearance and talking style). While previous works typically
solve this problem by learning an individual neural radiance field (NeRF) for
each identity to implicitly store its static and dynamic information, we find
it inefficient and non-generalized due to the per-identity-per-training
framework and the limited training data. To this end, we propose MimicTalk, the
first attempt that exploits the rich knowledge from a NeRF-based
person-agnostic generic model for improving the efficiency and robustness of
personalized TFG. To be specific, (1) we first come up with a person-agnostic
3D TFG model as the base model and propose to adapt it into a specific
identity; (2) we propose a static-dynamic-hybrid adaptation pipeline to help
the model learn the personalized static appearance and facial dynamic features;
(3) To generate the facial motion of the personalized talking style, we propose
an in-context stylized audio-to-motion model that mimics the implicit talking
style provided in the reference video without information loss by an explicit
style representation. The adaptation process to an unseen identity can be
performed in 15 minutes, which is 47 times faster than previous
person-dependent methods. Experiments show that our MimicTalk surpasses
previous baselines regarding video quality, efficiency, and expressiveness.

**Abstract**: Accurate and affordable indoor 3D reconstruction is critical for effective
robot navigation and interaction. Traditional LiDAR-based mapping provides high
precision but is costly, heavy, and power-intensive, with limited ability for
novel view rendering. Vision-based mapping, while cost-effective and capable of
capturing visual data, often struggles with high-quality 3D reconstruction due
to sparse point clouds. We propose ES-Gaussian, an end-to-end system using a
low-altitude camera and single-line LiDAR for high-quality 3D indoor
reconstruction. Our system features Visual Error Construction (VEC) to enhance
sparse point clouds by identifying and correcting areas with insufficient
geometric detail from 2D error maps. Additionally, we introduce a novel 3DGS
initialization method guided by single-line LiDAR, overcoming the limitations
of traditional multi-view setups and enabling effective reconstruction in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experimental results on our new
Dreame-SR dataset and a publicly available dataset demonstrate that ES-Gaussian
outperforms existing methods, particularly in challenging scenarios. The

**Abstract**: Many recent developments for robots to represent environments have focused on
photorealistic reconstructions. This paper particularly focuses on generating
sequences of images from the photorealistic Gaussian Splatting models, that
match instructions that are given by user-inputted language. We contribute a
novel framework, SplaTraj, which formulates the generation of images within
photorealistic environment representations as a continuous-time trajectory
optimization problem. Costs are designed so that a camera following the
trajectory poses will smoothly traverse through the environment and render the
specified spatial information in a photogenic manner. This is achieved by
querying a photorealistic representation with language embedding to isolate
regions that correspond to the user-specified inputs. These regions are then
projected to the camera's view as it moves over time and a cost is constructed.
We can then apply gradient-based optimization and differentiate through the
rendering to optimize the trajectory for the defined cost. The resulting
trajectory moves to photogenically view each of the specified objects. We
empirically evaluate our approach on a suite of environments and instructions,
and demonstrate the quality of generated image sequences.

**Abstract**: Accurate and efficient 3D reconstruction of trees is crucial for forest
resource assessments and management. Close-Range Photogrammetry (CRP) is
commonly used for reconstructing forest scenes but faces challenges like low
efficiency and poor quality. Recently, Novel View Synthesis (NVS) technologies,
including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have
shown promise for 3D plant reconstruction with limited images. However,
existing research mainly focuses on small plants in orchards or individual
trees, leaving uncertainty regarding their application in larger, complex
forest stands. In this study, we collected sequential images of forest plots
with varying complexity and performed dense reconstruction using NeRF and 3DGS.
The resulting point clouds were compared with those from photogrammetry and
laser scanning. Results indicate that NVS methods significantly enhance
reconstruction efficiency. Photogrammetry struggles with complex stands,
leading to point clouds with excessive canopy noise and incorrectly
reconstructed trees, such as duplicated trunks. NeRF, while better for canopy
regions, may produce errors in ground areas with limited views. The 3DGS method
generates sparser point clouds, particularly in trunk areas, affecting diameter
at breast height (DBH) accuracy. All three methods can extract tree height
information, with NeRF yielding the highest accuracy; however, photogrammetry
remains superior for DBH accuracy. These findings suggest that NVS methods have
significant potential for 3D reconstruction of forest stands, offering valuable
support for complex forest resource inventory and visualization tasks.

## HiSplat: Hierarchical 3D Gaussian Splatting for Generalizable  Sparse-View Reconstruction

| 2024-10-08 | Shengji Tang, Weicai Ye, Peng Ye, Weihao Lin, Yang Zhou, Tao Chen, Wanli Ouyang | cs.CV | [PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06245v1){: .btn .btn-green } |

**Abstract**: Reconstructing 3D scenes from multiple viewpoints is a fundamental task in
stereo vision. Recently, advances in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting have
enabled high-quality novel view synthesis for unseen scenes from sparse input
views by feed-forward predicting per-pixel Gaussian parameters without extra
optimization. However, existing methods typically generate single-scale 3D
Gaussians, which lack representation of both large-scale structure and texture
details, resulting in mislocation and artefacts. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework, HiSplat, which introduces a hierarchical manner in
generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct hierarchical 3D Gaussians via
a coarse-to-fine strategy. Specifically, HiSplat generates large coarse-grained
Gaussians to capture large-scale structures, followed by fine-grained Gaussians
to enhance delicate texture details. To promote inter-scale interactions, we
propose an Error Aware Module for Gaussian compensation and a Modulating Fusion
Module for Gaussian repair. Our method achieves joint optimization of
hierarchical representations, allowing for novel view synthesis using only
two-view reference images. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that HiSplat significantly enhances reconstruction quality and
cross-dataset generalization compared to prior single-scale methods. The
corresponding ablation study and analysis of different-scale 3D Gaussians
reveal the mechanism behind the effectiveness. Project website:

**Abstract**: We present GSLoc: a new visual localization method that performs dense camera
alignment using 3D Gaussian Splatting as a map representation of the scene.
GSLoc backpropagates pose gradients over the rendering pipeline to align the
rendered and target images, while it adopts a coarse-to-fine strategy by
utilizing blurring kernels to mitigate the non-convexity of the problem and
improve the convergence. The results show that our approach succeeds at visual
localization in challenging conditions of relatively small overlap between
initial and target frames inside textureless environments when state-of-the-art
neural sparse methods provide inferior results. Using the byproduct of
realistic rendering from the 3DGS map representation, we show how to enhance
localization results by mixing a set of observed and virtual reference
keyframes when solving the image retrieval problem. We evaluate our method both
on synthetic and real-world data, discussing its advantages and application
potential.

**Abstract**: We propose RelitLRM, a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) for generating
high-quality Gaussian splatting representations of 3D objects under novel
illuminations from sparse (4-8) posed images captured under unknown static
lighting. Unlike prior inverse rendering methods requiring dense captures and
slow optimization, often causing artifacts like incorrect highlights or shadow
baking, RelitLRM adopts a feed-forward transformer-based model with a novel
combination of a geometry reconstructor and a relightable appearance generator
based on diffusion. The model is trained end-to-end on synthetic multi-view
renderings of objects under varying known illuminations. This architecture
design enables to effectively decompose geometry and appearance, resolve the
ambiguity between material and lighting, and capture the multi-modal
distribution of shadows and specularity in the relit appearance. We show our
sparse-view feed-forward RelitLRM offers competitive relighting results to
state-of-the-art dense-view optimization-based baselines while being
significantly faster. Our project page is available at:

**Abstract**: View synthesis using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
(GS) has demonstrated impressive fidelity in rendering real-world scenarios.
However, practical methods for accurate and efficient epistemic Uncertainty
Quantification (UQ) in view synthesis are lacking. Existing approaches for NeRF
either introduce significant computational overhead (e.g., ``10x increase in
training time" or ``10x repeated training") or are limited to specific
uncertainty conditions or models. Notably, GS models lack any systematic
approach for comprehensive epistemic UQ. This capability is crucial for
improving the robustness and scalability of neural view synthesis, enabling
active model updates, error estimation, and scalable ensemble modeling based on
uncertainty. In this paper, we revisit NeRF and GS-based methods from a
function approximation perspective, identifying key differences and connections
in 3D representation learning. Building on these insights, we introduce
PH-Dropout (Post hoc Dropout), the first real-time and accurate method for
epistemic uncertainty estimation that operates directly on pre-trained NeRF and
GS models. Extensive evaluations validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate the effectiveness of PH-Dropout.

**Abstract**: LiDAR simulation plays a crucial role in closed-loop simulation for
autonomous driving. Although recent advancements, such as the use of
reconstructed mesh and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), have made progress in
simulating the physical properties of LiDAR, these methods have struggled to
achieve satisfactory frame rates and rendering quality. To address these
limitations, we present LiDAR-GS, the first LiDAR Gaussian Splatting method,
for real-time high-fidelity re-simulation of LiDAR sensor scans in public urban
road scenes. The vanilla Gaussian Splatting, designed for camera models, cannot
be directly applied to LiDAR re-simulation. To bridge the gap between passive
camera and active LiDAR, our LiDAR-GS designs a differentiable laser beam
splatting, grounded in the LiDAR range view model. This innovation allows for
precise surface splatting by projecting lasers onto micro cross-sections,
effectively eliminating artifacts associated with local affine approximations.
Additionally, LiDAR-GS leverages Neural Gaussian Fields, which further
integrate view-dependent clues, to represent key LiDAR properties that are
influenced by the incident angle and external factors. Combining these
practices with some essential adaptations, e.g., dynamic instances
decomposition, our approach succeeds in simultaneously re-simulating depth,
intensity, and ray-drop channels, achieving state-of-the-art results in both
rendering frame rate and quality on publically available large scene datasets.
Our source code will be made publicly available.

## PhotoReg: Photometrically Registering 3D Gaussian Splatting Models

**Abstract**: Building accurate representations of the environment is critical for
intelligent robots to make decisions during deployment. Advances in
photorealistic environment models have enabled robots to develop
hyper-realistic reconstructions, which can be used to generate images that are
intuitive for human inspection. In particular, the recently introduced
\ac{3DGS}, which describes the scene with up to millions of primitive
ellipsoids, can be rendered in real time. \ac{3DGS} has rapidly gained
prominence. However, a critical unsolved problem persists: how can we fuse
multiple \ac{3DGS} into a single coherent model? Solving this problem will
enable robot teams to jointly build \ac{3DGS} models of their surroundings. A
key insight of this work is to leverage the {duality} between photorealistic
reconstructions, which render realistic 2D images from 3D structure, and
\emph{3D foundation models}, which predict 3D structure from image pairs. To
this end, we develop PhotoReg, a framework to register multiple photorealistic
\ac{3DGS} models with 3D foundation models. As \ac{3DGS} models are generally
built from monocular camera images, they have \emph{arbitrary scale}. To
resolve this, PhotoReg actively enforces scale consistency among the different
\ac{3DGS} models by considering depth estimates within these models. Then, the
alignment is iteratively refined with fine-grained photometric losses to
produce high-quality fused \ac{3DGS} models. We rigorously evaluate PhotoReg on
both standard benchmark datasets and our custom-collected datasets, including
with two quadruped robots. The code is released at

**Abstract**: Novel view synthesis has advanced significantly with the development of
neural radiance fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). However,
achieving high quality without compromising real-time rendering remains
challenging, particularly for physically-based ray tracing with view-dependent
effects. Recently, N-dimensional Gaussians (N-DG) introduced a 6D
spatial-angular representation to better incorporate view-dependent effects,
but the Gaussian representation and control scheme are sub-optimal. In this
paper, we revisit 6D Gaussians and introduce 6D Gaussian Splatting (6DGS),
which enhances color and opacity representations and leverages the additional
directional information in the 6D space for optimized Gaussian control. Our
approach is fully compatible with the 3DGS framework and significantly improves
real-time radiance field rendering by better modeling view-dependent effects
and fine details. Experiments demonstrate that 6DGS significantly outperforms
3DGS and N-DG, achieving up to a 15.73 dB improvement in PSNR with a reduction
of 66.5% Gaussian points compared to 3DGS.

## DreamSat: Towards a General 3D Model for Novel View Synthesis of Space  Objects

**Abstract**: Novel view synthesis (NVS) enables to generate new images of a scene or
convert a set of 2D images into a comprehensive 3D model. In the context of
Space Domain Awareness, since space is becoming increasingly congested, NVS can
accurately map space objects and debris, improving the safety and efficiency of
space operations. Similarly, in Rendezvous and Proximity Operations missions,
3D models can provide details about a target object's shape, size, and
orientation, allowing for better planning and prediction of the target's
behavior. In this work, we explore the generalization abilities of these
reconstruction techniques, aiming to avoid the necessity of retraining for each
new scene, by presenting a novel approach to 3D spacecraft reconstruction from
single-view images, DreamSat, by fine-tuning the Zero123 XL, a state-of-the-art
single-view reconstruction model, on a high-quality dataset of 190 high-quality
spacecraft models and integrating it into the DreamGaussian framework. We
demonstrate consistent improvements in reconstruction quality across multiple
metrics, including Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) score
(+0.33%), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) (+2.53%), Structural Similarity
Index (SSIM) (+2.38%), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS)
(+0.16%) on a test set of 30 previously unseen spacecraft images. Our method
addresses the lack of domain-specific 3D reconstruction tools in the space
industry by leveraging state-of-the-art diffusion models and 3D Gaussian
splatting techniques. This approach maintains the efficiency of the
DreamGaussian framework while enhancing the accuracy and detail of spacecraft
reconstructions. The code for this work can be accessed on GitHub

## Next Best Sense: Guiding Vision and Touch with FisherRF for 3D Gaussian  Splatting

**Abstract**: We propose a framework for active next best view and touch selection for
robotic manipulators using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). 3DGS is emerging as a
useful explicit 3D scene representation for robotics, as it has the ability to
represent scenes in a both photorealistic and geometrically accurate manner.
However, in real-world, online robotic scenes where the number of views is
limited given efficiency requirements, random view selection for 3DGS becomes
impractical as views are often overlapping and redundant. We address this issue
by proposing an end-to-end online training and active view selection pipeline,
which enhances the performance of 3DGS in few-view robotics settings. We first
elevate the performance of few-shot 3DGS with a novel semantic depth alignment
method using Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) that we supplement with Pearson
depth and surface normal loss to improve color and depth reconstruction of
real-world scenes. We then extend FisherRF, a next-best-view selection method
for 3DGS, to select views and touch poses based on depth uncertainty. We
perform online view selection on a real robot system during live 3DGS training.
We motivate our improvements to few-shot GS scenes, and extend depth-based
FisherRF to them, where we demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative
improvements on challenging robot scenes. For more information, please see our
project page at https://armlabstanford.github.io/next-best-sense.

## Toward General Object-level Mapping from Sparse Views with 3D Diffusion  Priors

**Abstract**: Object-level mapping builds a 3D map of objects in a scene with detailed
shapes and poses from multi-view sensor observations. Conventional methods
struggle to build complete shapes and estimate accurate poses due to partial
occlusions and sensor noise. They require dense observations to cover all
objects, which is challenging to achieve in robotics trajectories. Recent work
introduces generative shape priors for object-level mapping from sparse views,
but is limited to single-category objects. In this work, we propose a General
Object-level Mapping system, GOM, which leverages a 3D diffusion model as shape
prior with multi-category support and outputs Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)
for both texture and geometry for all objects in a scene. GOM includes an
effective formulation to guide a pre-trained diffusion model with extra
nonlinear constraints from sensor measurements without finetuning. We also
develop a probabilistic optimization formulation to fuse multi-view sensor
observations and diffusion priors for joint 3D object pose and shape
estimation. Our GOM system demonstrates superior multi-category mapping
performance from sparse views, and achieves more accurate mapping results
compared to state-of-the-art methods on the real-world benchmarks. We will
release our code: https://github.com/TRAILab/GeneralObjectMapping.

**Abstract**: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention for its
exceptional visual effects. However, most existing NeRF methods reconstruct 3D
scenes from RGB images captured by visible light cameras. In practical
scenarios like darkness, low light, or bad weather, visible light cameras
become ineffective. Therefore, we propose TeX-NeRF, a 3D reconstruction method
using only infrared images, which introduces the object material emissivity as
a priori, preprocesses the infrared images using Pseudo-TeX vision, and maps
the temperatures (T), emissivities (e), and textures (X) of the scene into the
saturation (S), hue (H), and value (V) channels of the HSV color space,
respectively. Novel view synthesis using the processed images has yielded
excellent results. Additionally, we introduce 3D-TeX Datasets, the first
dataset comprising infrared images and their corresponding Pseudo-TeX vision
images. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only matches the quality of
scene reconstruction achieved with high-quality RGB images but also provides
accurate temperature estimations for objects in the scene.

## GS-VTON: Controllable 3D Virtual Try-on with Gaussian Splatting

**Abstract**: Diffusion-based 2D virtual try-on (VTON) techniques have recently
demonstrated strong performance, while the development of 3D VTON has largely
lagged behind. Despite recent advances in text-guided 3D scene editing,
integrating 2D VTON into these pipelines to achieve vivid 3D VTON remains
challenging. The reasons are twofold. First, text prompts cannot provide
sufficient details in describing clothing. Second, 2D VTON results generated
from different viewpoints of the same 3D scene lack coherence and spatial
relationships, hence frequently leading to appearance inconsistencies and
geometric distortions. To resolve these problems, we introduce an
image-prompted 3D VTON method (dubbed GS-VTON) which, by leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) as the 3D representation, enables the transfer of pre-trained

Specifically, we propose a personalized diffusion model that utilizes low-rank

**Abstract**: While neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown promise in novel view
synthesis, their implicit representation limits explicit control over object
manipulation. Existing research has proposed the integration of explicit
geometric proxies to enable deformation. However, these methods face two
primary challenges: firstly, the time-consuming and computationally demanding
tetrahedralization process; and secondly, handling complex or thin structures
often leads to either excessive, storage-intensive tetrahedral meshes or
poor-quality ones that impair deformation capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose DeformRF, a method that seamlessly integrates the
manipulability of tetrahedral meshes with the high-quality rendering
capabilities of feature grid representations. To avoid ill-shaped tetrahedra
and tetrahedralization for each object, we propose a two-stage training
strategy. Starting with an almost-regular tetrahedral grid, our model initially
retains key tetrahedra surrounding the object and subsequently refines object
details using finer-granularity mesh in the second stage. We also present the
concept of recursively subdivided tetrahedra to create higher-resolution meshes
implicitly. This enables multi-resolution encoding while only necessitating the
storage of the coarse tetrahedral mesh generated in the first training stage.
We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our DeformRF on both synthetic and
real-captured datasets. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method for novel view synthesis and deformation tasks.

**Abstract**: We present a novel-view rendering algorithm, Mode-GS, for ground-robot
trajectory datasets. Our approach is based on using anchored Gaussian splats,
which are designed to overcome the limitations of existing 3D Gaussian
splatting algorithms. Prior neural rendering methods suffer from severe splat
drift due to scene complexity and insufficient multi-view observation, and can
fail to fix splats on the true geometry in ground-robot datasets. Our method
integrates pixel-aligned anchors from monocular depths and generates Gaussian
splats around these anchors using residual-form Gaussian decoders. To address
the inherent scale ambiguity of monocular depth, we parameterize anchors with
per-view depth-scales and employ scale-consistent depth loss for online scale
calibration. Our method results in improved rendering performance, based on
PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, in ground scenes with free trajectory patterns,
and achieves state-of-the-art rendering performance on the R3LIVE odometry
dataset and the Tanks and Temples dataset.

**Abstract**: Reconstructing urban street scenes is crucial due to its vital role in
applications such as autonomous driving and urban planning. These scenes are
characterized by long and narrow camera trajectories, occlusion, complex object
relationships, and data sparsity across multiple scales. Despite recent
advancements, existing surface reconstruction methods, which are primarily
designed for object-centric scenarios, struggle to adapt effectively to the
unique characteristics of street scenes. To address this challenge, we
introduce StreetSurfGS, the first method to employ Gaussian Splatting
specifically tailored for scalable urban street scene surface reconstruction.
StreetSurfGS utilizes a planar-based octree representation and segmented
training to reduce memory costs, accommodate unique camera characteristics, and
ensure scalability. Additionally, to mitigate depth inaccuracies caused by
object overlap, we propose a guided smoothing strategy within regularization to
eliminate inaccurate boundary points and outliers. Furthermore, to address
sparse views and multi-scale challenges, we use a dual-step matching strategy
that leverages adjacent and long-term information. Extensive experiments
validate the efficacy of StreetSurfGS in both novel view synthesis and surface
reconstruction.

**Abstract**: The 3D reconstruction of the surgical field in minimally invasive endoscopic
surgery has posed a formidable challenge when using conventional monocular
endoscopes. Existing 3D reconstruction methodologies are frequently encumbered
by suboptimal accuracy and limited generalization capabilities. In this study,
we introduce an innovative pipeline using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for 3D
reconstruction. Our approach utilizes a preliminary NeRF reconstruction that
yields a coarse model, then creates a binocular scene within the reconstructed
environment, which derives an initial depth map via stereo vision. This initial
depth map serves as depth supervision for subsequent NeRF iterations,
progressively refining the 3D reconstruction with enhanced accuracy. The
binocular depth is iteratively recalculated, with the refinement process
continuing until the depth map converges, and exhibits negligible variations.
Through this recursive process, high-fidelity depth maps are generated from
monocular endoscopic video of a realistic cranial phantom. By repeated measures
of the final 3D reconstruction compared to X-ray computed tomography, all
differences of relevant clinical distances result in sub-millimeter accuracy.

**Abstract**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a promising approach for
modeling 3D scenes using mixtures of Gaussians. The predominant optimization
method for these models relies on backpropagating gradients through a
differentiable rendering pipeline, which struggles with catastrophic forgetting
when dealing with continuous streams of data. To address this limitation, we
propose Variational Bayes Gaussian Splatting (VBGS), a novel approach that
frames training a Gaussian splat as variational inference over model
parameters. By leveraging the conjugacy properties of multivariate Gaussians,
we derive a closed-form variational update rule, allowing efficient updates
from partial, sequential observations without the need for replay buffers. Our
experiments show that VBGS not only matches state-of-the-art performance on
static datasets, but also enables continual learning from sequentially streamed
2D and 3D data, drastically improving performance in this setting.

**Abstract**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exceled in novel view synthesis
with its real-time rendering capabilities and superior quality. However, it
faces challenges for high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) due to the
coarse nature of primitives derived from low-resolution input views. To address
this issue, we propose Super-Resolution 3DGS (SuperGS), which is an expansion
of 3DGS designed with a two-stage coarse-to-fine training framework, utilizing
pretrained low-resolution scene representation as an initialization for
super-resolution optimization. Moreover, we introduce Multi-resolution Feature
Gaussian Splatting (MFGS) to incorporates a latent feature field for flexible
feature sampling and Gradient-guided Selective Splitting (GSS) for effective
Gaussian upsampling. By integrating these strategies within the coarse-to-fine
framework ensure both high fidelity and memory efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SuperGS surpasses state-of-the-art HRNVS methods
on challenging real-world datasets using only low-resolution inputs.

**Abstract**: We introduce a simple yet effective approach for separating transmitted and
reflected light. Our key insight is that the powerful novel view synthesis
capabilities provided by modern inverse rendering methods (e.g.,~3D Gaussian
splatting) allow one to perform flash/no-flash reflection separation using
unpaired measurements -- this relaxation dramatically simplifies image
acquisition over conventional paired flash/no-flash reflection separation
methods. Through extensive real-world experiments, we demonstrate our method,
Flash-Splat, accurately reconstructs both transmitted and reflected scenes in
3D. Our method outperforms existing 3D reflection separation methods, which do
not leverage illumination control, by a large margin. Our project webpage is at

**Abstract**: We present GI-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework that leverages 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and deferred shading to achieve photo-realistic novel
view synthesis and relighting. In inverse rendering, accurately modeling the
shading processes of objects is essential for achieving high-fidelity results.
Therefore, it is critical to incorporate global illumination to account for
indirect lighting that reaches an object after multiple bounces across the
scene. Previous 3DGS-based methods have attempted to model indirect lighting by
characterizing indirect illumination as learnable lighting volumes or
additional attributes of each Gaussian, while using baked occlusion to
represent shadow effects. These methods, however, fail to accurately model the
complex physical interactions between light and objects, making it impossible
to construct realistic indirect illumination during relighting. To address this
limitation, we propose to calculate indirect lighting using efficient path
tracing with deferred shading. In our framework, we first render a G-buffer to
capture the detailed geometry and material properties of the scene. Then, we
perform physically-based rendering (PBR) only for direct lighting. With the
G-buffer and previous rendering results, the indirect lighting can be
calculated through a lightweight path tracing. Our method effectively models
indirect lighting under any given lighting conditions, thereby achieving better
novel view synthesis and relighting. Quantitative and qualitative results show
that our GI-GS outperforms existing baselines in both rendering quality and
efficiency.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) offers the capability to achieve real-time high
quality 3D scene rendering. However, 3DGS assumes that the scene is in a clear
medium environment and struggles to generate satisfactory representations in
underwater scenes, where light absorption and scattering are prevalent and
moving objects are involved. To overcome these, we introduce a novel Gaussian
Splatting-based method, UW-GS, designed specifically for underwater
applications. It introduces a color appearance that models distance-dependent
color variation, employs a new physics-based density control strategy to
enhance clarity for distant objects, and uses a binary motion mask to handle
dynamic content. Optimized with a well-designed loss function supporting for
scattering media and strengthened by pseudo-depth maps, UW-GS outperforms
existing methods with PSNR gains up to 1.26dB. To fully verify the
effectiveness of the model, we also developed a new underwater dataset, S-UW,
with dynamic object masks.

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are widely used for novel-view synthesis and
have been adapted for 3D Object Detection (3DOD), offering a promising approach
to 3DOD through view-synthesis representation. However, NeRF faces inherent
limitations: (i) limited representational capacity for 3DOD due to its implicit
nature, and (ii) slow rendering speeds. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
has emerged as an explicit 3D representation that addresses these limitations.
Inspired by these advantages, this paper introduces 3DGS into 3DOD for the
first time, identifying two main challenges: (i) Ambiguous spatial distribution
of Gaussian blobs: 3DGS primarily relies on 2D pixel-level supervision,
resulting in unclear 3D spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs and poor
differentiation between objects and background, which hinders 3DOD; (ii)
Excessive background blobs: 2D images often include numerous background pixels,
leading to densely reconstructed 3DGS with many noisy Gaussian blobs
representing the background, negatively affecting detection. To tackle the
challenge (i), we leverage the fact that 3DGS reconstruction is derived from 2D
images, and propose an elegant and efficient solution by incorporating 2D
Boundary Guidance to significantly enhance the spatial distribution of Gaussian
blobs, resulting in clearer differentiation between objects and their
background. To address the challenge (ii), we propose a Box-Focused Sampling
strategy using 2D boxes to generate object probability distribution in 3D
spaces, allowing effective probabilistic sampling in 3D to retain more object
blobs and reduce noisy background blobs. Benefiting from our designs, our
3DGS-DET significantly outperforms the SOTA NeRF-based method, NeRF-Det,
achieving improvements of +6.6 on mAP@0.25 and +8.1 on mAP@0.5 for the ScanNet
dataset, and impressive +31.5 on mAP@0.25 for the ARKITScenes dataset.

**Abstract**: The feed-forward based 3D Gaussian Splatting method has demonstrated
exceptional capability in real-time human novel view synthesis. However,
existing approaches are restricted to dense viewpoint settings, which limits
their flexibility in free-viewpoint rendering across a wide range of camera
view angle discrepancies. To address this limitation, we propose a real-time
pipeline named EVA-Gaussian for 3D human novel view synthesis across diverse
camera settings. Specifically, we first introduce an Efficient cross-View
Attention (EVA) module to accurately estimate the position of each 3D Gaussian
from the source images. Then, we integrate the source images with the estimated
Gaussian position map to predict the attributes and feature embeddings of the
3D Gaussians. Moreover, we employ a recurrent feature refiner to correct
artifacts caused by geometric errors in position estimation and enhance visual
fidelity.To further improve synthesis quality, we incorporate a powerful anchor
loss function for both 3D Gaussian attributes and human face landmarks.
Experimental results on the THuman2.0 and THumansit datasets showcase the
superiority of our EVA-Gaussian approach in rendering quality across diverse
camera settings. Project page:

**Abstract**: Skins wrapping around our bodies, leathers covering over the sofa, sheet
metal coating the car - it suggests that objects are enclosed by a series of
continuous surfaces, which provides us with informative geometry prior for
objectness deduction. In this paper, we propose Gaussian-Det which leverages
Gaussian Splatting as surface representation for multi-view based 3D object
detection. Unlike existing monocular or NeRF-based methods which depict the
objects via discrete positional data, Gaussian-Det models the objects in a
continuous manner by formulating the input Gaussians as feature descriptors on
a mass of partial surfaces. Furthermore, to address the numerous outliers
inherently introduced by Gaussian splatting, we accordingly devise a Closure
Inferring Module (CIM) for the comprehensive surface-based objectness
deduction. CIM firstly estimates the probabilistic feature residuals for
partial surfaces given the underdetermined nature of Gaussian Splatting, which
are then coalesced into a holistic representation on the overall surface
closure of the object proposal. In this way, the surface information
Gaussian-Det exploits serves as the prior on the quality and reliability of
objectness and the information basis of proposal refinement. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Gaussian-Det
outperforms various existing approaches, in terms of both average precision and
recall.

**Abstract**: Recent works in volume rendering, \textit{e.g.} NeRF and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), significantly advance the rendering quality and efficiency
with the help of the learned implicit neural radiance field or 3D Gaussians.
Rendering on top of an explicit representation, the vanilla 3DGS and its
variants deliver real-time efficiency by optimizing the parametric model with
single-view supervision per iteration during training which is adopted from
NeRF. Consequently, certain views are overfitted, leading to unsatisfying
appearance in novel-view synthesis and imprecise 3D geometries. To solve
aforementioned problems, we propose a new 3DGS optimization method embodying
four key novel contributions: 1) We transform the conventional single-view
training paradigm into a multi-view training strategy. With our proposed
multi-view regulation, 3D Gaussian attributes are further optimized without
overfitting certain training views. As a general solution, we improve the
overall accuracy in a variety of scenarios and different Gaussian variants. 2)
Inspired by the benefit introduced by additional views, we further propose a
cross-intrinsic guidance scheme, leading to a coarse-to-fine training procedure
concerning different resolutions. 3) Built on top of our multi-view regulated
training, we further propose a cross-ray densification strategy, densifying
more Gaussian kernels in the ray-intersect regions from a selection of views.
4) By further investigating the densification strategy, we found that the
effect of densification should be enhanced when certain views are distinct
dramatically. As a solution, we propose a novel multi-view augmented
densification strategy, where 3D Gaussians are encouraged to get densified to a
sufficient number accordingly, resulting in improved reconstruction accuracy.

**Abstract**: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) approximate discrete data through
continuous functions and are commonly used for encoding 2D images. Traditional
image-based INRs employ neural networks to map pixel coordinates to RGB values,
capturing shapes, colors, and textures within the network's weights. Recently,
GaussianImage has been proposed as an alternative, using Gaussian functions
instead of neural networks to achieve comparable quality and compression. Such
a solution obtains a quality and compression ratio similar to classical INR
models but does not allow image modification. In contrast, our work introduces
a novel method, MiraGe, which uses mirror reflections to perceive 2D images in
3D space and employs flat-controlled Gaussians for precise 2D image editing.
Our approach improves the rendering quality and allows realistic image
modifications, including human-inspired perception of photos in the 3D world.
Thanks to modeling images in 3D space, we obtain the illusion of 3D-based
modification in 2D images. We also show that our Gaussian representation can be
easily combined with a physics engine to produce physics-based modification of
2D images. Consequently, MiraGe allows for better quality than the standard
approach and natural modification of 2D images.

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) have revolutionized
novel view synthesis, facilitating real-time, high-quality image rendering.
However, in scenarios involving reflective surfaces, particularly mirrors,
3D-GS often misinterprets reflections as virtual spaces, resulting in blurred
and inconsistent multi-view rendering within mirrors. Our paper presents a
novel method aimed at obtaining high-quality multi-view consistent reflection
rendering by modelling reflections as physically-based virtual cameras. We
estimate mirror planes with depth and normal estimates from 3D-GS and define
virtual cameras that are placed symmetrically about the mirror plane. These
virtual cameras are then used to explain mirror reflections in the scene. To
address imperfections in mirror plane estimates, we propose a straightforward
yet effective virtual camera optimization method to enhance reflection quality.
We collect a new mirror dataset including three real-world scenarios for more
diverse evaluation. Experimental validation on both Mirror-Nerf and our
real-world dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. We achieve
comparable or superior results while significantly reducing training time
compared to previous state-of-the-art.

**Abstract**: Recently, with the development of Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian
Splatting, 3D reconstruction techniques have achieved remarkably high fidelity.
However, the latent representations learnt by these methods are highly
entangled and lack interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel
part-aware compositional reconstruction method, called GaussianBlock, that
enables semantically coherent and disentangled representations, allowing for
precise and physical editing akin to building blocks, while simultaneously
maintaining high fidelity. Our GaussianBlock introduces a hybrid representation
that leverages the advantages of both primitives, known for their flexible
actionability and editability, and 3D Gaussians, which excel in reconstruction
quality. Specifically, we achieve semantically coherent primitives through a
novel attention-guided centering loss derived from 2D semantic priors,
complemented by a dynamic splitting and fusion strategy. Furthermore, we
utilize 3D Gaussians that hybridize with primitives to refine structural
details and enhance fidelity. Additionally, a binding inheritance strategy is
employed to strengthen and maintain the connection between the two. Our
reconstructed scenes are evidenced to be disentangled, compositional, and
compact across diverse benchmarks, enabling seamless, direct and precise
editing while maintaining high quality.

**Abstract**: We present Exact Volumetric Ellipsoid Rendering (EVER), a method for
real-time differentiable emission-only volume rendering. Unlike recent
rasterization based approach by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), our primitive
based representation allows for exact volume rendering, rather than alpha
compositing 3D Gaussian billboards. As such, unlike 3DGS our formulation does
not suffer from popping artifacts and view dependent density, but still
achieves frame rates of $\sim\!30$ FPS at 720p on an NVIDIA RTX4090. Since our
approach is built upon ray tracing it enables effects such as defocus blur and
camera distortion (e.g. such as from fisheye cameras), which are difficult to
achieve by rasterization. We show that our method is more accurate with fewer
blending issues than 3DGS and follow-up work on view-consistent rendering,
especially on the challenging large-scale scenes from the Zip-NeRF dataset
where it achieves sharpest results among real-time techniques.

**Abstract**: Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to diagnose and
treat joint problems. The clinical workflow of arthroscopy typically involves
inserting an arthroscope into the joint through a small incision, during which
surgeons navigate and operate largely by relying on their visual assessment
through the arthroscope. However, the arthroscope's restricted field of view
and lack of depth perception pose challenges in navigating complex articular
structures and achieving surgical precision during procedures. Aiming at
enhancing intraoperative awareness, we present a robust pipeline that
incorporates simultaneous localization and mapping, depth estimation, and 3D
Gaussian splatting to realistically reconstruct intra-articular structures
solely based on monocular arthroscope video. Extending 3D reconstruction to
Augmented Reality (AR) applications, our solution offers AR assistance for
articular notch measurement and annotation anchoring in a human-in-the-loop
manner. Compared to traditional Structure-from-Motion and Neural Radiance
Field-based methods, our pipeline achieves dense 3D reconstruction and
competitive rendering fidelity with explicit 3D representation in 7 minutes on
average. When evaluated on four phantom datasets, our method achieves RMSE =
2.21mm reconstruction error, PSNR = 32.86 and SSIM = 0.89 on average. Because
our pipeline enables AR reconstruction and guidance directly from monocular
arthroscopy without any additional data and/or hardware, our solution may hold
the potential for enhancing intraoperative awareness and facilitating surgical
precision in arthroscopy. Our AR measurement tool achieves accuracy within 1.59
+/- 1.81mm and the AR annotation tool achieves a mIoU of 0.721.

**Abstract**: Place recognition is a crucial module to ensure autonomous vehicles obtain
usable localization information in GPS-denied environments. In recent years,
multimodal place recognition methods have gained increasing attention due to
their ability to overcome the weaknesses of unimodal sensor systems by
leveraging complementary information from different modalities. However,
challenges arise from the necessity of harmonizing data across modalities and
exploiting the spatio-temporal correlations between them sufficiently. In this
paper, we propose a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based multimodal place recognition
neural network dubbed GSPR. It explicitly combines multi-view RGB images and
LiDAR point clouds into a spatio-temporally unified scene representation with
the proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. A network composed of 3D graph
convolution and transformer is designed to extract high-level spatio-temporal
features and global descriptors from the Gaussian scenes for place recognition.
We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset, and the experimental results
demonstrate that our method can effectively leverage complementary strengths of
both multi-view cameras and LiDAR, achieving SOTA place recognition performance
while maintaining solid generalization ability. Our open-source code is

**Abstract**: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is pivotal in robotics, with
photorealistic scene reconstruction emerging as a key challenge. To address
this, we introduce Computational Alignment for Real-Time Gaussian Splatting
SLAM (CaRtGS), a novel method enhancing the efficiency and quality of
photorealistic scene reconstruction in real-time environments. Leveraging 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), CaRtGS achieves superior rendering quality and
processing speed, which is crucial for scene photorealistic reconstruction. Our
approach tackles computational misalignment in Gaussian Splatting SLAM
(GS-SLAM) through an adaptive strategy that optimizes training, addresses
long-tail optimization, and refines densification. Experiments on Replica and
TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate CaRtGS's effectiveness in achieving high-fidelity
rendering with fewer Gaussian primitives. This work propels SLAM towards
real-time, photorealistic dense rendering, significantly advancing
photorealistic scene representation. For the benefit of the research community,
we release the code on our project website:
https://dapengfeng.github.io/cartgs.

Comments:
- Upon a thorough internal review, we have identified that our
  manuscript lacks proper citation for a critical expression within the
  methodology section. In this revised version, we add Taming-3DGS as a
  citation in the splat-wise backpropagation statement

**Abstract**: Novel view synthesis (NVS) aims to generate images at arbitrary viewpoints
using multi-view images, and recent insights from neural radiance fields (NeRF)
have contributed to remarkable improvements. Recently, studies on generalizable
NeRF (G-NeRF) have addressed the challenge of per-scene optimization in NeRFs.
The construction of radiance fields on-the-fly in G-NeRF simplifies the NVS
process, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Meanwhile, G-NeRF
still struggles in representing fine details for a specific scene due to the
absence of per-scene optimization, even with texture-rich multi-view source
inputs. As a remedy, we propose a Geometry-driven Multi-reference Texture
transfer network (GMT) available as a plug-and-play module designed for G-NeRF.
Specifically, we propose ray-imposed deformable convolution (RayDCN), which
aligns input and reference features reflecting scene geometry. Additionally,
the proposed texture preserving transformer (TP-Former) aggregates multi-view
source features while preserving texture information. Consequently, our module
enables direct interaction between adjacent pixels during the image enhancement
process, which is deficient in G-NeRF models with an independent rendering
process per pixel. This addresses constraints that hinder the ability to
capture high-frequency details. Experiments show that our plug-and-play module
consistently improves G-NeRF models on various benchmark datasets.
