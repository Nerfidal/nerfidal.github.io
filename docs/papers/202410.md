**Abstract**: We present Exact Volumetric Ellipsoid Rendering (EVER), a method for
real-time differentiable emission-only volume rendering. Unlike recent
rasterization based approach by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), our primitive
based representation allows for exact volume rendering, rather than alpha
compositing 3D Gaussian billboards. As such, unlike 3DGS our formulation does
not suffer from popping artifacts and view dependent density, but still
achieves frame rates of $\sim\!30$ FPS at 720p on an NVIDIA RTX4090. Since our
approach is built upon ray tracing it enables effects such as defocus blur and
camera distortion (e.g. such as from fisheye cameras), which are difficult to
achieve by rasterization. We show that our method is more accurate with fewer
blending issues than 3DGS and follow-up work on view-consistent rendering,
especially on the challenging large-scale scenes from the Zip-NeRF dataset
where it achieves sharpest results among real-time techniques.

**Abstract**: The feed-forward based 3D Gaussian Splatting method has demonstrated
exceptional capability in real-time human novel view synthesis. However,
existing approaches are restricted to dense viewpoint settings, which limits
their flexibility in free-viewpoint rendering across a wide range of camera
view angle discrepancies. To address this limitation, we propose a real-time
pipeline named EVA-Gaussian for 3D human novel view synthesis across diverse
camera settings. Specifically, we first introduce an Efficient cross-View
Attention (EVA) module to accurately estimate the position of each 3D Gaussian
from the source images. Then, we integrate the source images with the estimated
Gaussian position map to predict the attributes and feature embeddings of the
3D Gaussians. Moreover, we employ a recurrent feature refiner to correct
artifacts caused by geometric errors in position estimation and enhance visual
fidelity.To further improve synthesis quality, we incorporate a powerful anchor
loss function for both 3D Gaussian attributes and human face landmarks.
Experimental results on the THuman2.0 and THumansit datasets showcase the
superiority of our EVA-Gaussian approach in rendering quality across diverse
camera settings. Project page:

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are widely used for novel-view synthesis and
have been adapted for 3D Object Detection (3DOD), offering a promising approach
to 3DOD through view-synthesis representation. However, NeRF faces inherent
limitations: (i) limited representational capacity for 3DOD due to its implicit
nature, and (ii) slow rendering speeds. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
has emerged as an explicit 3D representation that addresses these limitations.
Inspired by these advantages, this paper introduces 3DGS into 3DOD for the
first time, identifying two main challenges: (i) Ambiguous spatial distribution
of Gaussian blobs: 3DGS primarily relies on 2D pixel-level supervision,
resulting in unclear 3D spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs and poor
differentiation between objects and background, which hinders 3DOD; (ii)
Excessive background blobs: 2D images often include numerous background pixels,
leading to densely reconstructed 3DGS with many noisy Gaussian blobs
representing the background, negatively affecting detection. To tackle the
challenge (i), we leverage the fact that 3DGS reconstruction is derived from 2D
images, and propose an elegant and efficient solution by incorporating 2D
Boundary Guidance to significantly enhance the spatial distribution of Gaussian
blobs, resulting in clearer differentiation between objects and their
background. To address the challenge (ii), we propose a Box-Focused Sampling
strategy using 2D boxes to generate object probability distribution in 3D
spaces, allowing effective probabilistic sampling in 3D to retain more object
blobs and reduce noisy background blobs. Benefiting from our designs, our
3DGS-DET significantly outperforms the SOTA NeRF-based method, NeRF-Det,
achieving improvements of +6.6 on mAP@0.25 and +8.1 on mAP@0.5 for the ScanNet
dataset, and impressive +31.5 on mAP@0.25 for the ARKITScenes dataset.

**Abstract**: Skins wrapping around our bodies, leathers covering over the sofa, sheet
metal coating the car - it suggests that objects are enclosed by a series of
continuous surfaces, which provides us with informative geometry prior for
objectness deduction. In this paper, we propose Gaussian-Det which leverages
Gaussian Splatting as surface representation for multi-view based 3D object
detection. Unlike existing monocular or NeRF-based methods which depict the
objects via discrete positional data, Gaussian-Det models the objects in a
continuous manner by formulating the input Gaussians as feature descriptors on
a mass of partial surfaces. Furthermore, to address the numerous outliers
inherently introduced by Gaussian splatting, we accordingly devise a Closure
Inferring Module (CIM) for the comprehensive surface-based objectness
deduction. CIM firstly estimates the probabilistic feature residuals for
partial surfaces given the underdetermined nature of Gaussian Splatting, which
are then coalesced into a holistic representation on the overall surface
closure of the object proposal. In this way, the surface information
Gaussian-Det exploits serves as the prior on the quality and reliability of
objectness and the information basis of proposal refinement. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Gaussian-Det
outperforms various existing approaches, in terms of both average precision and
recall.

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) have revolutionized
novel view synthesis, facilitating real-time, high-quality image rendering.
However, in scenarios involving reflective surfaces, particularly mirrors,
3D-GS often misinterprets reflections as virtual spaces, resulting in blurred
and inconsistent multi-view rendering within mirrors. Our paper presents a
novel method aimed at obtaining high-quality multi-view consistent reflection
rendering by modelling reflections as physically-based virtual cameras. We
estimate mirror planes with depth and normal estimates from 3D-GS and define
virtual cameras that are placed symmetrically about the mirror plane. These
virtual cameras are then used to explain mirror reflections in the scene. To
address imperfections in mirror plane estimates, we propose a straightforward
yet effective virtual camera optimization method to enhance reflection quality.
We collect a new mirror dataset including three real-world scenarios for more
diverse evaluation. Experimental validation on both Mirror-Nerf and our
real-world dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. We achieve
comparable or superior results while significantly reducing training time
compared to previous state-of-the-art.

## UW-GS: Distractor-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting for Enhanced Underwater  Scene Reconstruction

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) offers the capability to achieve real-time high
quality 3D scene rendering. However, 3DGS assumes that the scene is in a clear
medium environment and struggles to generate satisfactory representations in
underwater scenes, where light absorption and scattering are prevalent and
moving objects are involved. To overcome these, we introduce a novel Gaussian
Splatting-based method, UW-GS, designed specifically for underwater
applications. It introduces a color appearance that models distance-dependent
color variation, employs a new physics-based density control strategy to
enhance clarity for distant objects, and uses a binary motion mask to handle
dynamic content. Optimized with a well-designed loss function supporting for
scattering media and strengthened by pseudo-depth maps, UW-GS outperforms
existing methods with PSNR gains up to 1.26dB. To fully verify the
effectiveness of the model, we also developed a new underwater dataset, S-UW,
with dynamic object masks.

**Abstract**: Recently, with the development of Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian
Splatting, 3D reconstruction techniques have achieved remarkably high fidelity.
However, the latent representations learnt by these methods are highly
entangled and lack interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel
part-aware compositional reconstruction method, called GaussianBlock, that
enables semantically coherent and disentangled representations, allowing for
precise and physical editing akin to building blocks, while simultaneously
maintaining high fidelity. Our GaussianBlock introduces a hybrid representation
that leverages the advantages of both primitives, known for their flexible
actionability and editability, and 3D Gaussians, which excel in reconstruction
quality. Specifically, we achieve semantically coherent primitives through a
novel attention-guided centering loss derived from 2D semantic priors,
complemented by a dynamic splitting and fusion strategy. Furthermore, we
utilize 3D Gaussians that hybridize with primitives to refine structural
details and enhance fidelity. Additionally, a binding inheritance strategy is
employed to strengthen and maintain the connection between the two. Our
reconstructed scenes are evidenced to be disentangled, compositional, and
compact across diverse benchmarks, enabling seamless, direct and precise
editing while maintaining high quality.

**Abstract**: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) approximate discrete data through
continuous functions and are commonly used for encoding 2D images. Traditional
image-based INRs employ neural networks to map pixel coordinates to RGB values,
capturing shapes, colors, and textures within the network's weights. Recently,
GaussianImage has been proposed as an alternative, using Gaussian functions
instead of neural networks to achieve comparable quality and compression. Such
a solution obtains a quality and compression ratio similar to classical INR
models but does not allow image modification. In contrast, our work introduces
a novel method, MiraGe, which uses mirror reflections to perceive 2D images in
3D space and employs flat-controlled Gaussians for precise 2D image editing.
Our approach improves the rendering quality and allows realistic image
modifications, including human-inspired perception of photos in the 3D world.
Thanks to modeling images in 3D space, we obtain the illusion of 3D-based
modification in 2D images. We also show that our Gaussian representation can be
easily combined with a physics engine to produce physics-based modification of
2D images. Consequently, MiraGe allows for better quality than the standard
approach and natural modification of 2D images.

**Abstract**: Novel view synthesis (NVS) aims to generate images at arbitrary viewpoints
using multi-view images, and recent insights from neural radiance fields (NeRF)
have contributed to remarkable improvements. Recently, studies on generalizable
NeRF (G-NeRF) have addressed the challenge of per-scene optimization in NeRFs.
The construction of radiance fields on-the-fly in G-NeRF simplifies the NVS
process, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Meanwhile, G-NeRF
still struggles in representing fine details for a specific scene due to the
absence of per-scene optimization, even with texture-rich multi-view source
inputs. As a remedy, we propose a Geometry-driven Multi-reference Texture
transfer network (GMT) available as a plug-and-play module designed for G-NeRF.
Specifically, we propose ray-imposed deformable convolution (RayDCN), which
aligns input and reference features reflecting scene geometry. Additionally,
the proposed texture preserving transformer (TP-Former) aggregates multi-view
source features while preserving texture information. Consequently, our module
enables direct interaction between adjacent pixels during the image enhancement
process, which is deficient in G-NeRF models with an independent rendering
process per pixel. This addresses constraints that hinder the ability to
capture high-frequency details. Experiments show that our plug-and-play module
consistently improves G-NeRF models on various benchmark datasets.

**Abstract**: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is pivotal in robotics, with
photorealistic scene reconstruction emerging as a key challenge. To address
this, we introduce Computational Alignment for Real-Time Gaussian Splatting
SLAM (CaRtGS), a novel method enhancing the efficiency and quality of
photorealistic scene reconstruction in real-time environments. Leveraging 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), CaRtGS achieves superior rendering quality and
processing speed, which is crucial for scene photorealistic reconstruction. Our
approach tackles computational misalignment in Gaussian Splatting SLAM
(GS-SLAM) through an adaptive strategy that optimizes training, addresses
long-tail optimization, and refines densification. Experiments on Replica and
TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate CaRtGS's effectiveness in achieving high-fidelity
rendering with fewer Gaussian primitives. This work propels SLAM towards
real-time, photorealistic dense rendering, significantly advancing
photorealistic scene representation. For the benefit of the research community,
we release the code on our project website:

**Abstract**: Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to diagnose and
treat joint problems. The clinical workflow of arthroscopy typically involves
inserting an arthroscope into the joint through a small incision, during which
surgeons navigate and operate largely by relying on their visual assessment
through the arthroscope. However, the arthroscope's restricted field of view
and lack of depth perception pose challenges in navigating complex articular
structures and achieving surgical precision during procedures. Aiming at
enhancing intraoperative awareness, we present a robust pipeline that
incorporates simultaneous localization and mapping, depth estimation, and 3D
Gaussian splatting to realistically reconstruct intra-articular structures
solely based on monocular arthroscope video. Extending 3D reconstruction to
Augmented Reality (AR) applications, our solution offers AR assistance for
articular notch measurement and annotation anchoring in a human-in-the-loop
manner. Compared to traditional Structure-from-Motion and Neural Radiance
Field-based methods, our pipeline achieves dense 3D reconstruction and
competitive rendering fidelity with explicit 3D representation in 7 minutes on
average. When evaluated on four phantom datasets, our method achieves RMSE =
2.21mm reconstruction error, PSNR = 32.86 and SSIM = 0.89 on average. Because
our pipeline enables AR reconstruction and guidance directly from monocular
arthroscopy without any additional data and/or hardware, our solution may hold
the potential for enhancing intraoperative awareness and facilitating surgical
precision in arthroscopy. Our AR measurement tool achieves accuracy within 1.59
+/- 1.81mm and the AR annotation tool achieves a mIoU of 0.721.

## GSPR: Multimodal Place Recognition Using 3D Gaussian Splatting for  Autonomous Driving

**Abstract**: Place recognition is a crucial module to ensure autonomous vehicles obtain
usable localization information in GPS-denied environments. In recent years,
multimodal place recognition methods have gained increasing attention due to
their ability to overcome the weaknesses of unimodal sensor systems by
leveraging complementary information from different modalities. However,
challenges arise from the necessity of harmonizing data across modalities and
exploiting the spatio-temporal correlations between them sufficiently. In this
paper, we propose a 3D Gaussian Splatting-based multimodal place recognition
neural network dubbed GSPR. It explicitly combines multi-view RGB images and
LiDAR point clouds into a spatio-temporally unified scene representation with
the proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. A network composed of 3D graph
convolution and transformer is designed to extract high-level spatio-temporal
features and global descriptors from the Gaussian scenes for place recognition.
We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset, and the experimental results
demonstrate that our method can effectively leverage complementary strengths of
both multi-view cameras and LiDAR, achieving SOTA place recognition performance
while maintaining solid generalization ability. Our open-source code is
available at https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/GSPR.
