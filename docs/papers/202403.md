| 2024-03-13 | Jing Wu, Jia-Wang Bian, Xinghui Li, Guangrun Wang, Ian Reid, Philip Torr, Victor Adrian Prisacariu | cs.CV | [PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08733v1){: .btn .btn-green } |

**Abstract**: We propose GaussCtrl, a text-driven method to edit a 3D scene reconstructed
by the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).
  Our method first renders a collection of images by using the 3DGS and edits
them by using a pre-trained 2D diffusion model (ControlNet) based on the input
prompt, which is then used to optimise the 3D model.
  Our key contribution is multi-view consistent editing, which enables editing
all images together instead of iteratively editing one image while updating the
3D model as in previous works.
  It leads to faster editing as well as higher visual quality.
  This is achieved by the two terms:
  (a) depth-conditioned editing that enforces geometric consistency across
multi-view images by leveraging naturally consistent depth maps.
  (b) attention-based latent code alignment that unifies the appearance of
edited images by conditioning their editing to several reference views through
self and cross-view attention between images' latent representations.
  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves faster editing and better
visual results than previous state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract**: Implicit neural representations (INRs) recently achieved great success in
image representation and compression, offering high visual quality and fast
rendering speeds with 10-1000 FPS, assuming sufficient GPU resources are
available. However, this requirement often hinders their use on low-end devices
with limited memory. In response, we propose a groundbreaking paradigm of image
representation and compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting, named GaussianImage.
We first introduce 2D Gaussian to represent the image, where each Gaussian has
8 parameters including position, covariance and color. Subsequently, we unveil
a novel rendering algorithm based on accumulated summation. Remarkably, our
method with a minimum of 3$\times$ lower GPU memory usage and 5$\times$ faster
fitting time not only rivals INRs (e.g., WIRE, I-NGP) in representation
performance, but also delivers a faster rendering speed of 1500-2000 FPS
regardless of parameter size. Furthermore, we integrate existing vector
quantization technique to build an image codec. Experimental results
demonstrate that our codec attains rate-distortion performance comparable to
compression-based INRs such as COIN and COIN++, while facilitating decoding
speeds of approximately 1000 FPS. Additionally, preliminary proof of concept
shows that our codec surpasses COIN and COIN++ in performance when using
partial bits-back coding.

**Abstract**: Scene stylization extends the work of neural style transfer to three spatial
dimensions. A vital challenge in this problem is to maintain the uniformity of
the stylized appearance across a multi-view setting. A vast majority of the
previous works achieve this by optimizing the scene with a specific style
image. In contrast, we propose a novel architecture trained on a collection of
style images, that at test time produces high quality stylized novel views. Our
work builds up on the framework of 3D Gaussian splatting. For a given scene, we
take the pretrained Gaussians and process them using a multi resolution hash
grid and a tiny MLP to obtain the conditional stylised views. The explicit
nature of 3D Gaussians give us inherent advantages over NeRF-based methods
including geometric consistency, along with having a fast training and
rendering regime. This enables our method to be useful for vast practical use
cases such as in augmented or virtual reality applications. Through our
experiments, we show our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance with
superior visual quality on various indoor and outdoor real-world data.

**Abstract**: Performing language-conditioned robotic manipulation tasks in unstructured
environments is highly demanded for general intelligent robots. Conventional
robotic manipulation methods usually learn semantic representation of the
observation for action prediction, which ignores the scene-level spatiotemporal
dynamics for human goal completion. In this paper, we propose a dynamic
Gaussian Splatting method named ManiGaussian for multi-task robotic
manipulation, which mines scene dynamics via future scene reconstruction.
Specifically, we first formulate the dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that
infers the semantics propagation in the Gaussian embedding space, where the
semantic representation is leveraged to predict the optimal robot action. Then,
we build a Gaussian world model to parameterize the distribution in our dynamic
Gaussian Splatting framework, which provides informative supervision in the
interactive environment via future scene reconstruction. We evaluate our
ManiGaussian on 10 RLBench tasks with 166 variations, and the results
demonstrate our framework can outperform the state-of-the-art methods by 13.1\%
in average success rate.

**Abstract**: 4D style transfer aims at transferring arbitrary visual style to the
synthesized novel views of a dynamic 4D scene with varying viewpoints and
times. Existing efforts on 3D style transfer can effectively combine the visual
features of style images and neural radiance fields (NeRF) but fail to handle
the 4D dynamic scenes limited by the static scene assumption. Consequently, we
aim to handle the novel challenging problem of 4D style transfer for the first
time, which further requires the consistency of stylized results on dynamic
objects. In this paper, we introduce StyleDyRF, a method that represents the 4D
feature space by deforming a canonical feature volume and learns a linear style
transformation matrix on the feature volume in a data-driven fashion. To obtain
the canonical feature volume, the rays at each time step are deformed with the
geometric prior of a pre-trained dynamic NeRF to render the feature map under
the supervision of pre-trained visual encoders. With the content and style cues
in the canonical feature volume and the style image, we can learn the style
transformation matrix from their covariance matrices with lightweight neural
networks. The learned style transformation matrix can reflect a direct matching
of feature covariance from the content volume to the given style pattern, in
analogy with the optimization of the Gram matrix in traditional 2D neural style
transfer. The experimental results show that our method not only renders 4D
photorealistic style transfer results in a zero-shot manner but also
outperforms existing methods in terms of visual quality and consistency.

**Abstract**: Feature point detection and description is the backbone for various computer
vision applications, such as Structure-from-Motion, visual SLAM, and visual
place recognition. While learning-based methods have surpassed traditional
handcrafted techniques, their training often relies on simplistic
homography-based simulations of multi-view perspectives, limiting model
generalisability. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging neural
radiance fields (NeRFs) for realistic multi-view training data generation. We
create a diverse multi-view dataset using NeRFs, consisting of indoor and
outdoor scenes. Our proposed methodology adapts state-of-the-art feature
detectors and descriptors to train on NeRF-synthesised views supervised by
perspective projective geometry. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
methods achieve competitive or superior performance on standard benchmarks for
relative pose estimation, point cloud registration, and homography estimation
while requiring significantly less training data compared to existing
approaches.

## SMURF: Continuous Dynamics for Motion-Deblurring Radiance Fields

**Abstract**: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) has attracted considerable attention for their
exceptional ability in synthesizing novel views with high fidelity. However,
the presence of motion blur, resulting from slight camera movements during
extended shutter exposures, poses a significant challenge, potentially
compromising the quality of the reconstructed 3D scenes. While recent studies
have addressed this issue, they do not consider the continuous dynamics of
camera movements during image acquisition, leading to inaccurate scene
reconstruction. Additionally, these methods are plagued by slow training and
rendering speed. To effectively handle these issues, we propose sequential
motion understanding radiance fields (SMURF), a novel approach that employs
neural ordinary differential equation (Neural-ODE) to model continuous camera
motion and leverages the explicit volumetric representation method for faster
training and robustness to motion-blurred input images. The core idea of the
SMURF is continuous motion blurring kernel (CMBK), a unique module designed to
model a continuous camera movements for processing blurry inputs. Our model,
rigorously evaluated against benchmark datasets, demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

**Abstract**: We propose SemGauss-SLAM, the first semantic SLAM system utilizing 3D
Gaussian representation, that enables accurate 3D semantic mapping, robust
camera tracking, and high-quality rendering in real-time. In this system, we
incorporate semantic feature embedding into 3D Gaussian representation, which
effectively encodes semantic information within the spatial layout of the
environment for precise semantic scene representation. Furthermore, we propose
feature-level loss for updating 3D Gaussian representation, enabling
higher-level guidance for 3D Gaussian optimization. In addition, to reduce
cumulative drift and improve reconstruction accuracy, we introduce
semantic-informed bundle adjustment leveraging semantic associations for joint
optimization of 3D Gaussian representation and camera poses, leading to more
robust tracking and consistent mapping. Our SemGauss-SLAM method demonstrates
superior performance over existing dense semantic SLAM methods in terms of
mapping and tracking accuracy on Replica and ScanNet datasets, while also
showing excellent capabilities in novel-view semantic synthesis and 3D semantic
mapping.

**Abstract**: We introduce StyleGaussian, a novel 3D style transfer technique that allows
instant transfer of any image's style to a 3D scene at 10 frames per second
(fps). Leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), StyleGaussian achieves style
transfer without compromising its real-time rendering ability and multi-view
consistency. It achieves instant style transfer with three steps: embedding,
transfer, and decoding. Initially, 2D VGG scene features are embedded into
reconstructed 3D Gaussians. Next, the embedded features are transformed
according to a reference style image. Finally, the transformed features are
decoded into the stylized RGB. StyleGaussian has two novel designs. The first
is an efficient feature rendering strategy that first renders low-dimensional
features and then maps them into high-dimensional features while embedding VGG
features. It cuts the memory consumption significantly and enables 3DGS to
render the high-dimensional memory-intensive features. The second is a
K-nearest-neighbor-based 3D CNN. Working as the decoder for the stylized
features, it eliminates the 2D CNN operations that compromise strict multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments show that StyleGaussian achieves instant 3D
stylization with superior stylization quality while preserving real-time
rendering and strict multi-view consistency. Project page:

## Q-SLAM: Quadric Representations for Monocular SLAM

**Abstract**: Monocular SLAM has long grappled with the challenge of accurately modeling 3D
geometries. Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based monocular
SLAM have shown promise, yet these methods typically focus on novel view
synthesis rather than precise 3D geometry modeling. This focus results in a
significant disconnect between NeRF applications, i.e., novel-view synthesis
and the requirements of SLAM. We identify that the gap results from the
volumetric representations used in NeRF, which are often dense and noisy. In
this study, we propose a novel approach that reimagines volumetric
representations through the lens of quadric forms. We posit that most scene
components can be effectively represented as quadric planes. Leveraging this
assumption, we reshape the volumetric representations with million of cubes by
several quadric planes, which leads to more accurate and efficient modeling of
3D scenes in SLAM contexts. Our method involves two key steps: First, we use
the quadric assumption to enhance coarse depth estimations obtained from
tracking modules, e.g., Droid-SLAM. This step alone significantly improves
depth estimation accuracy. Second, in the subsequent mapping phase, we diverge
from previous NeRF-based SLAM methods that distribute sampling points across
the entire volume space. Instead, we concentrate sampling points around quadric
planes and aggregate them using a novel quadric-decomposed Transformer.
Additionally, we introduce an end-to-end joint optimization strategy that
synchronizes pose estimation with 3D reconstruction.

**Abstract**: Novel view synthesis has observed tremendous developments since the arrival
of NeRFs. However, Nerf models overfit on a single scene, lacking
generalization to out of distribution objects. Recently, diffusion models have
exhibited remarkable performance on introducing generalization in view
synthesis. Inspired by these advancements, we explore the capabilities of a
pretrained stable diffusion model for view synthesis without explicit 3D
priors. Specifically, we base our method on a personalized text to image model,
Dreambooth, given its strong ability to adapt to specific novel objects with a
few shots. Our research reveals two interesting findings. First, we observe
that Dreambooth can learn the high level concept of a view, compared to
arguably more complex strategies which involve finetuning diffusions on large
amounts of multi-view data. Second, we establish that the concept of a view can
be disentangled and transferred to a novel object irrespective of the original
object's identify from which the views are learnt. Motivated by this, we
introduce a learning strategy, FSViewFusion, which inherits a specific view
through only one image sample of a single scene, and transfers the knowledge to
a novel object, learnt from few shots, using low rank adapters. Through
extensive experiments we demonstrate that our method, albeit simple, is
efficient in generating reliable view samples for in the wild images. Code and
models will be released.

## DNGaussian: Optimizing Sparse-View 3D Gaussian Radiance Fields with  Global-Local Depth Normalization

**Abstract**: Radiance fields have demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing
novel views from sparse input views, yet prevailing methods suffer from high
training costs and slow inference speed. This paper introduces DNGaussian, a
depth-regularized framework based on 3D Gaussian radiance fields, offering
real-time and high-quality few-shot novel view synthesis at low costs. Our
motivation stems from the highly efficient representation and surprising
quality of the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting, despite it will encounter a
geometry degradation when input views decrease. In the Gaussian radiance
fields, we find this degradation in scene geometry primarily lined to the
positioning of Gaussian primitives and can be mitigated by depth constraint.
Consequently, we propose a Hard and Soft Depth Regularization to restore
accurate scene geometry under coarse monocular depth supervision while
maintaining a fine-grained color appearance. To further refine detailed
geometry reshaping, we introduce Global-Local Depth Normalization, enhancing
the focus on small local depth changes. Extensive experiments on LLFF, DTU, and
Blender datasets demonstrate that DNGaussian outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving comparable or better results with significantly reduced
memory cost, a $25 \times$ reduction in training time, and over $3000 \times$
faster rendering speed.

## Vosh: Voxel-Mesh Hybrid Representation for Real-Time View Synthesis

**Abstract**: The neural radiance field (NeRF) has emerged as a prominent methodology for
synthesizing realistic images of novel views. While neural radiance
representations based on voxels or mesh individually offer distinct advantages,
excelling in either rendering quality or speed, each has limitations in the
other aspect. In response, we propose a pioneering hybrid representation named
Vosh, seamlessly combining both voxel and mesh components in hybrid rendering
for view synthesis. Vosh is meticulously crafted by optimizing the voxel grid
of NeRF, strategically with selected voxels replaced by mesh. Therefore, it
excels in fast rendering scenes with simple geometry and textures through its
mesh component, while simultaneously enabling high-quality rendering in
intricate regions by leveraging voxel component. The flexibility of Vosh is
showcased through the ability to adjust hybrid ratios, providing users the
ability to control the balance between rendering quality and speed based on
flexible usage. Experimental results demonstrates that our method achieves
commendable trade-off between rendering quality and speed, and notably has
real-time performance on mobile devices.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian splatting has achieved very impressive performance in real-time
novel view synthesis. However, it often suffers from over-reconstruction during
Gaussian densification where high-variance image regions are covered by a few
large Gaussians only, leading to blur and artifacts in the rendered images. We
design a progressive frequency regularization (FreGS) technique to tackle the
over-reconstruction issue within the frequency space. Specifically, FreGS
performs coarse-to-fine Gaussian densification by exploiting low-to-high
frequency components that can be easily extracted with low-pass and high-pass
filters in the Fourier space. By minimizing the discrepancy between the
frequency spectrum of the rendered image and the corresponding ground truth, it
achieves high-quality Gaussian densification and alleviates the
over-reconstruction of Gaussian splatting effectively. Experiments over
multiple widely adopted benchmarks (e.g., Mip-NeRF360, Tanks-and-Temples and
Deep Blending) show that FreGS achieves superior novel view synthesis and
outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently.

**Abstract**: We present a neural-field-based large-scale reconstruction system that fuses

surface normals. We exploit the trajectory from a real-time lidar SLAM system
to bootstrap a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) procedure to both significantly
reduce the computation time and to provide metric scale which is crucial for
lidar depth loss. We use submapping to scale the system to large-scale
environments captured over long trajectories. We demonstrate the reconstruction
system with data from a multi-camera, lidar sensor suite onboard a legged
robot, hand-held while scanning building scenes for 600 metres, and onboard an
aerial robot surveying a multi-storey mock disaster site-building. Website:

## Is Vanilla MLP in Neural Radiance Field Enough for Few-shot View  Synthesis?

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has achieved superior performance for novel view
synthesis by modeling the scene with a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) and a
volume rendering procedure, however, when fewer known views are given (i.e.,
few-shot view synthesis), the model is prone to overfit the given views. To
handle this issue, previous efforts have been made towards leveraging learned
priors or introducing additional regularizations. In contrast, in this paper,
we for the first time provide an orthogonal method from the perspective of
network structure. Given the observation that trivially reducing the number of
model parameters alleviates the overfitting issue, but at the cost of missing
details, we propose the multi-input MLP (mi-MLP) that incorporates the inputs
(i.e., location and viewing direction) of the vanilla MLP into each layer to
prevent the overfitting issue without harming detailed synthesis. To further
reduce the artifacts, we propose to model colors and volume density separately
and present two regularization terms. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that: 1) although the proposed mi-MLP is easy to
implement, it is surprisingly effective as it boosts the PSNR of the baseline
from $14.73$ to $24.23$. 2) the overall framework achieves state-of-the-art
results on a wide range of benchmarks. We will release the code upon
publication.

**Abstract**: Recent studies have highlighted the promising application of NeRF in
autonomous driving contexts. However, the complexity of outdoor environments,
combined with the restricted viewpoints in driving scenarios, complicates the
task of precisely reconstructing scene geometry. Such challenges often lead to
diminished quality in reconstructions and extended durations for both training
and rendering. To tackle these challenges, we present Lightning NeRF. It uses
an efficient hybrid scene representation that effectively utilizes the geometry
prior from LiDAR in autonomous driving scenarios. Lightning NeRF significantly
improves the novel view synthesis performance of NeRF and reduces computational
overheads. Through evaluations on real-world datasets, such as KITTI-360,
Argoverse2, and our private dataset, we demonstrate that our approach not only
exceeds the current state-of-the-art in novel view synthesis quality but also
achieves a five-fold increase in training speed and a ten-fold improvement in
rendering speed. Codes are available at

**Abstract**: Semantic Communication (SC) is a novel paradigm for data transmission in 6G.
However, there are several challenges posed when performing SC in 3D scenarios:
1) 3D semantic extraction; 2) Latent semantic redundancy; and 3) Uncertain
channel estimation. To address these issues, we propose a Generative AI Model
assisted 3D SC (GAM-3DSC) system. Firstly, we introduce a 3D Semantic Extractor
(3DSE), which employs generative AI models, including Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), to extract key semantics from a 3D
scenario based on user requirements. The extracted 3D semantics are represented
as multi-perspective images of the goal-oriented 3D object. Then, we present an
Adaptive Semantic Compression Model (ASCM) for encoding these multi-perspective
images, in which we use a semantic encoder with two output heads to perform
semantic encoding and mask redundant semantics in the latent semantic space,
respectively. Next, we design a conditional Generative adversarial network and
Diffusion model aided-Channel Estimation (GDCE) to estimate and refine the
Channel State Information (CSI) of physical channels. Finally, simulation
results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed GAM-3DSC system in
effectively transmitting the goal-oriented 3D scenario.

**Abstract**: We present GSEdit, a pipeline for text-guided 3D object editing based on
Gaussian Splatting models. Our method enables the editing of the style and
appearance of 3D objects without altering their main details, all in a matter
of minutes on consumer hardware. We tackle the problem by leveraging Gaussian
splatting to represent 3D scenes, and we optimize the model while progressively
varying the image supervision by means of a pretrained image-based diffusion
model. The input object may be given as a 3D triangular mesh, or directly
provided as Gaussians from a generative model such as DreamGaussian. GSEdit
ensures consistency across different viewpoints, maintaining the integrity of
the original object's information. Compared to previously proposed methods
relying on NeRF-like MLP models, GSEdit stands out for its efficiency, making
3D editing tasks much faster. Our editing process is refined via the
application of the SDS loss, ensuring that our edits are both precise and
accurate. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that GSEdit effectively
alters object shape and appearance following the given textual instructions
while preserving their coherence and detail.

**Abstract**: We present SplattingAvatar, a hybrid 3D representation of photorealistic
human avatars with Gaussian Splatting embedded on a triangle mesh, which
renders over 300 FPS on a modern GPU and 30 FPS on a mobile device. We
disentangle the motion and appearance of a virtual human with explicit mesh
geometry and implicit appearance modeling with Gaussian Splatting. The
Gaussians are defined by barycentric coordinates and displacement on a triangle
mesh as Phong surfaces. We extend lifted optimization to simultaneously
optimize the parameters of the Gaussians while walking on the triangle mesh.
SplattingAvatar is a hybrid representation of virtual humans where the mesh
represents low-frequency motion and surface deformation, while the Gaussians
take over the high-frequency geometry and detailed appearance. Unlike existing
deformation methods that rely on an MLP-based linear blend skinning (LBS) field
for motion, we control the rotation and translation of the Gaussians directly
by mesh, which empowers its compatibility with various animation techniques,
e.g., skeletal animation, blend shapes, and mesh editing. Trainable from
monocular videos for both full-body and head avatars, SplattingAvatar shows
state-of-the-art rendering quality across multiple datasets.

**Abstract**: This paper presents DNAct, a language-conditioned multi-task policy framework
that integrates neural rendering pre-training and diffusion training to enforce
multi-modality learning in action sequence spaces. To learn a generalizable
multi-task policy with few demonstrations, the pre-training phase of DNAct
leverages neural rendering to distill 2D semantic features from foundation
models such as Stable Diffusion to a 3D space, which provides a comprehensive
semantic understanding regarding the scene. Consequently, it allows various
applications to challenging robotic tasks requiring rich 3D semantics and
accurate geometry. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach utilizing
diffusion training to learn a vision and language feature that encapsulates the
inherent multi-modality in the multi-task demonstrations. By reconstructing the
action sequences from different tasks via the diffusion process, the model is
capable of distinguishing different modalities and thus improving the
robustness and the generalizability of the learned representation. DNAct
significantly surpasses SOTA NeRF-based multi-task manipulation approaches with
over 30% improvement in success rate. Project website: dnact.github.io.

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have quickly become the primary approach for 3D
reconstruction and novel view synthesis in recent years due to their remarkable
performance. Despite the huge interest in NeRF methods, a practical use case of
NeRFs has largely been ignored; the exploration of the scene space modelled by
a NeRF. In this paper, for the first time in the literature, we propose and
formally define the scene exploration framework as the efficient discovery of
NeRF model inputs (i.e. coordinates and viewing angles), using which one can
render novel views that adhere to user-selected criteria. To remedy the lack of
approaches addressing scene exploration, we first propose two baseline methods
called Guided-Random Search (GRS) and Pose Interpolation-based Search (PIBS).
We then cast scene exploration as an optimization problem, and propose the
criteria-agnostic Evolution-Guided Pose Search (EGPS) for efficient
exploration. We test all three approaches with various criteria (e.g. saliency
maximization, image quality maximization, photo-composition quality
improvement) and show that our EGPS performs more favourably than other
baselines. We finally highlight key points and limitations, and outline
directions for future research in scene exploration.

**Abstract**: Deep learning methods for perception are the cornerstone of many robotic
systems. Despite their potential for impressive performance, obtaining
real-world training data is expensive, and can be impractically difficult for
some tasks. Sim-to-real transfer with domain randomization offers a potential
workaround, but often requires extensive manual tuning and results in models
that are brittle to distribution shift between sim and real. In this work, we
introduce Composable Object Volume NeRF (COV-NeRF), an object-composable NeRF
model that is the centerpiece of a real-to-sim pipeline for synthesizing
training data targeted to scenes and objects from the real world. COV-NeRF
extracts objects from real images and composes them into new scenes, generating
photorealistic renderings and many types of 2D and 3D supervision, including
depth maps, segmentation masks, and meshes. We show that COV-NeRF matches the
rendering quality of modern NeRF methods, and can be used to rapidly close the
sim-to-real gap across a variety of perceptual modalities.

**Abstract**: Recent efforts in using 3D Gaussians for scene reconstruction and novel view
synthesis can achieve impressive results on curated benchmarks; however, images
captured in real life are often blurry. In this work, we analyze the robustness
of Gaussian-Splatting-based methods against various image blur, such as motion
blur, defocus blur, downscaling blur, \etc. Under these degradations,
Gaussian-Splatting-based methods tend to overfit and produce worse results than
Neural-Radiance-Field-based methods. To address this issue, we propose Blur
Agnostic Gaussian Splatting (BAGS). BAGS introduces additional 2D modeling
capacities such that a 3D-consistent and high quality scene can be
reconstructed despite image-wise blur. Specifically, we model blur by
estimating per-pixel convolution kernels from a Blur Proposal Network (BPN).
BPN is designed to consider spatial, color, and depth variations of the scene
to maximize modeling capacity. Additionally, BPN also proposes a
quality-assessing mask, which indicates regions where blur occur. Finally, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine kernel optimization scheme; this optimization scheme
is fast and avoids sub-optimal solutions due to a sparse point cloud
initialization, which often occurs when we apply Structure-from-Motion on
blurry images. We demonstrate that BAGS achieves photorealistic renderings
under various challenging blur conditions and imaging geometry, while
significantly improving upon existing approaches.

**Abstract**: X-ray is widely applied for transmission imaging due to its stronger
penetration than natural light. When rendering novel view X-ray projections,
existing methods mainly based on NeRF suffer from long training time and slow
inference speed. In this paper, we propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based
framework, namely X-Gaussian, for X-ray novel view synthesis. Firstly, we
redesign a radiative Gaussian point cloud model inspired by the isotropic
nature of X-ray imaging. Our model excludes the influence of view direction
when learning to predict the radiation intensity of 3D points. Based on this
model, we develop a Differentiable Radiative Rasterization (DRR) with CUDA
implementation. Secondly, we customize an Angle-pose Cuboid Uniform
Initialization (ACUI) strategy that directly uses the parameters of the X-ray
scanner to compute the camera information and then uniformly samples point
positions within a cuboid enclosing the scanned object. Experiments show that
our X-Gaussian outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 6.5 dB while enjoying
less than 15% training time and over 73x inference speed. The application on
sparse-view CT reconstruction also reveals the practical values of our method.
Code and models will be publicly available at

**Abstract**: Utilizing multi-view inputs to synthesize novel-view images, Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a popular research topic in 3D vision. In this
work, we introduce a Generalizable Semantic Neural Radiance Field (GSNeRF),
which uniquely takes image semantics into the synthesis process so that both
novel view images and the associated semantic maps can be produced for unseen
scenes. Our GSNeRF is composed of two stages: Semantic Geo-Reasoning and
Depth-Guided Visual rendering. The former is able to observe multi-view image
inputs to extract semantic and geometry features from a scene. Guided by the
resulting image geometry information, the latter performs both image and
semantic rendering with improved performances. Our experiments not only confirm
that GSNeRF performs favorably against prior works on both novel-view image and
semantic segmentation synthesis but the effectiveness of our sampling strategy
for visual rendering is further verified.

**Abstract**: We present NeWRF, a deep learning framework for predicting wireless channels.
Wireless channel prediction is a long-standing problem in the wireless
community and is a key technology for improving the coverage of wireless
network deployments. Today, a wireless deployment is evaluated by a site survey
which is a cumbersome process requiring an experienced engineer to perform
extensive channel measurements. To reduce the cost of site surveys, we develop
NeWRF, which is based on recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF).
NeWRF trains a neural network model with a sparse set of channel measurements,
and predicts the wireless channel accurately at any location in the site. We
introduce a series of techniques that integrate wireless propagation properties
into the NeRF framework to account for the fundamental differences between the
behavior of light and wireless signals. We conduct extensive evaluations of our
framework and show that our approach can accurately predict channels at
unvisited locations with significantly lower measurement density than prior
state-of-the-art

**Abstract**: We present Splat-Nav, a navigation pipeline that consists of a real-time safe
planning module and a robust state estimation module designed to operate in the
Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) environment representation, a popular emerging 3D
scene representation from computer vision. We formulate rigorous collision
constraints that can be computed quickly to build a guaranteed-safe polytope
corridor through the map. We then optimize a B-spline trajectory through this
corridor. We also develop a real-time, robust state estimation module by
interpreting the GSplat representation as a point cloud. The module enables the
robot to localize its global pose with zero prior knowledge from RGB-D images
using point cloud alignment, and then track its own pose as it moves through
the scene from RGB images using image-to-point cloud localization. We also
incorporate semantics into the GSplat in order to obtain better images for
localization. All of these modules operate mainly on CPU, freeing up GPU
resources for tasks like real-time scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the
safety and robustness of our pipeline in both simulation and hardware, where we
show re-planning at 5 Hz and pose estimation at 20 Hz, an order of magnitude
faster than Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based navigation methods, thereby
enabling real-time navigation.

**Abstract**: Addressing the intricate challenge of modeling and re-rendering dynamic
scenes, most recent approaches have sought to simplify these complexities using
plane-based explicit representations, overcoming the slow training time issues
associated with methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and implicit
representations. However, the straightforward decomposition of 4D dynamic
scenes into multiple 2D plane-based representations proves insufficient for
re-rendering high-fidelity scenes with complex motions. In response, we present
a novel direction-aware representation (DaRe) approach that captures scene
dynamics from six different directions. This learned representation undergoes
an inverse dual-tree complex wavelet transformation (DTCWT) to recover
plane-based information. DaReNeRF computes features for each space-time point
by fusing vectors from these recovered planes. Combining DaReNeRF with a tiny
MLP for color regression and leveraging volume rendering in training yield
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis for complex dynamic
scenes. Notably, to address redundancy introduced by the six real and six
imaginary direction-aware wavelet coefficients, we introduce a trainable
masking approach, mitigating storage issues without significant performance
decline. Moreover, DaReNeRF maintains a 2x reduction in training time compared
to prior art while delivering superior performance.

**Abstract**: Novel-view synthesis with sparse input views is important for real-world
applications like AR/VR and autonomous driving. Recent methods have integrated
depth information into NeRFs for sparse input synthesis, leveraging depth prior
for geometric and spatial understanding. However, most existing works tend to
overlook inaccuracies within depth maps and have low time efficiency. To
address these issues, we propose a depth-guided robust and fast point cloud
fusion NeRF for sparse inputs. We perceive radiance fields as an explicit voxel
grid of features. A point cloud is constructed for each input view,
characterized within the voxel grid using matrices and vectors. We accumulate
the point cloud of each input view to construct the fused point cloud of the
entire scene. Each voxel determines its density and appearance by referring to
the point cloud of the entire scene. Through point cloud fusion and voxel grid
fine-tuning, inaccuracies in depth values are refined or substituted by those
from other views. Moreover, our method can achieve faster reconstruction and
greater compactness through effective vector-matrix decomposition. Experimental
results underline the superior performance and time efficiency of our approach
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

**Abstract**: This study presents a novel approach for generating holograms based on the
neural radiance fields (NeRF) technique. Generating three-dimensional (3D) data
is difficult in hologram computation. NeRF is a state-of-the-art technique for
3D light-field reconstruction from 2D images based on volume rendering. The
NeRF can rapidly predict new-view images that do not include a training
dataset. In this study, we constructed a rendering pipeline directly from a 3D
light field generated from 2D images by NeRF for hologram generation using deep
neural networks within a reasonable time. The pipeline comprises three main
components: the NeRF, a depth predictor, and a hologram generator, all
constructed using deep neural networks. The pipeline does not include any
physical calculations. The predicted holograms of a 3D scene viewed from any
direction were computed using the proposed pipeline. The simulation and
experimental results are presented.

**Abstract**: Neural field methods have seen great progress in various long-standing tasks
in computer vision and computer graphics, including novel view synthesis and
geometry reconstruction. As existing neural field methods try to predict some
coordinate-based continuous target values, such as RGB for Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF), all of these methods are regression models and are optimized by
some regression loss. However, are regression models really better than
classification models for neural field methods? In this work, we try to visit
this very fundamental but overlooked question for neural fields from a machine
learning perspective. We successfully propose a novel Neural Field Classifier
(NFC) framework which formulates existing neural field methods as
classification tasks rather than regression tasks. The proposed NFC can easily
transform arbitrary Neural Field Regressor (NFR) into its classification
variant via employing a novel Target Encoding module and optimizing a
classification loss. By encoding a continuous regression target into a
high-dimensional discrete encoding, we naturally formulate a multi-label
classification task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive
effectiveness of NFC at the nearly free extra computational costs. Moreover,
NFC also shows robustness to sparse inputs, corrupted images, and dynamic
scenes.

## NeRF-VPT: Learning Novel View Representations with Neural Radiance  Fields via View Prompt Tuning

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have garnered remarkable success in novel view
synthesis. Nonetheless, the task of generating high-quality images for novel
views persists as a critical challenge. While the existing efforts have
exhibited commendable progress, capturing intricate details, enhancing
textures, and achieving superior Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metrics
warrant further focused attention and advancement. In this work, we propose
NeRF-VPT, an innovative method for novel view synthesis to address these
challenges. Our proposed NeRF-VPT employs a cascading view prompt tuning
paradigm, wherein RGB information gained from preceding rendering outcomes
serves as instructive visual prompts for subsequent rendering stages, with the
aspiration that the prior knowledge embedded in the prompts can facilitate the
gradual enhancement of rendered image quality. NeRF-VPT only requires sampling
RGB data from previous stage renderings as priors at each training stage,
without relying on extra guidance or complex techniques. Thus, our NeRF-VPT is
plug-and-play and can be readily integrated into existing methods. By
conducting comparative analyses of our NeRF-VPT against several NeRF-based
approaches on demanding real-scene benchmarks, such as Realistic Synthetic 360,
Real Forward-Facing, Replica dataset, and a user-captured dataset, we
substantiate that our NeRF-VPT significantly elevates baseline performance and
proficiently generates more high-quality novel view images than all the
compared state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the cascading learning of
NeRF-VPT introduces adaptability to scenarios with sparse inputs, resulting in
a significant enhancement of accuracy for sparse-view novel view synthesis. The

**Abstract**: We present a framework, DISORF, to enable online 3D reconstruction and
visualization of scenes captured by resource-constrained mobile robots and edge
devices. To address the limited compute capabilities of edge devices and
potentially limited network availability, we design a framework that
efficiently distributes computation between the edge device and remote server.
We leverage on-device SLAM systems to generate posed keyframes and transmit
them to remote servers that can perform high quality 3D reconstruction and
visualization at runtime by leveraging NeRF models. We identify a key challenge
with online NeRF training where naive image sampling strategies can lead to
significant degradation in rendering quality. We propose a novel shifted
exponential frame sampling method that addresses this challenge for online NeRF
training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in enabling
high-quality real-time reconstruction and visualization of unknown scenes as
they are captured and streamed from cameras in mobile robots and edge devices.
