**Abstract**: Utilizing multi-view inputs to synthesize novel-view images, Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a popular research topic in 3D vision. In this
work, we introduce a Generalizable Semantic Neural Radiance Field (GSNeRF),
which uniquely takes image semantics into the synthesis process so that both
novel view images and the associated semantic maps can be produced for unseen
scenes. Our GSNeRF is composed of two stages: Semantic Geo-Reasoning and
Depth-Guided Visual rendering. The former is able to observe multi-view image
inputs to extract semantic and geometry features from a scene. Guided by the
resulting image geometry information, the latter performs both image and
semantic rendering with improved performances. Our experiments not only confirm
that GSNeRF performs favorably against prior works on both novel-view image and
semantic segmentation synthesis but the effectiveness of our sampling strategy
for visual rendering is further verified.

**Abstract**: We present Splat-Nav, a navigation pipeline that consists of a real-time safe
planning module and a robust state estimation module designed to operate in the
Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) environment representation, a popular emerging 3D
scene representation from computer vision. We formulate rigorous collision
constraints that can be computed quickly to build a guaranteed-safe polytope
corridor through the map. We then optimize a B-spline trajectory through this
corridor. We also develop a real-time, robust state estimation module by
interpreting the GSplat representation as a point cloud. The module enables the
robot to localize its global pose with zero prior knowledge from RGB-D images
using point cloud alignment, and then track its own pose as it moves through
the scene from RGB images using image-to-point cloud localization. We also
incorporate semantics into the GSplat in order to obtain better images for
localization. All of these modules operate mainly on CPU, freeing up GPU
resources for tasks like real-time scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the
safety and robustness of our pipeline in both simulation and hardware, where we
show re-planning at 5 Hz and pose estimation at 20 Hz, an order of magnitude
faster than Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based navigation methods, thereby
enabling real-time navigation.

**Abstract**: We present NeWRF, a deep learning framework for predicting wireless channels.
Wireless channel prediction is a long-standing problem in the wireless
community and is a key technology for improving the coverage of wireless
network deployments. Today, a wireless deployment is evaluated by a site survey
which is a cumbersome process requiring an experienced engineer to perform
extensive channel measurements. To reduce the cost of site surveys, we develop
NeWRF, which is based on recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF).
NeWRF trains a neural network model with a sparse set of channel measurements,
and predicts the wireless channel accurately at any location in the site. We
introduce a series of techniques that integrate wireless propagation properties
into the NeRF framework to account for the fundamental differences between the
behavior of light and wireless signals. We conduct extensive evaluations of our
framework and show that our approach can accurately predict channels at
unvisited locations with significantly lower measurement density than prior
state-of-the-art

**Abstract**: Addressing the intricate challenge of modeling and re-rendering dynamic
scenes, most recent approaches have sought to simplify these complexities using
plane-based explicit representations, overcoming the slow training time issues
associated with methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and implicit
representations. However, the straightforward decomposition of 4D dynamic
scenes into multiple 2D plane-based representations proves insufficient for
re-rendering high-fidelity scenes with complex motions. In response, we present
a novel direction-aware representation (DaRe) approach that captures scene
dynamics from six different directions. This learned representation undergoes
an inverse dual-tree complex wavelet transformation (DTCWT) to recover
plane-based information. DaReNeRF computes features for each space-time point
by fusing vectors from these recovered planes. Combining DaReNeRF with a tiny
MLP for color regression and leveraging volume rendering in training yield
state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis for complex dynamic
scenes. Notably, to address redundancy introduced by the six real and six
imaginary direction-aware wavelet coefficients, we introduce a trainable
masking approach, mitigating storage issues without significant performance
decline. Moreover, DaReNeRF maintains a 2x reduction in training time compared
to prior art while delivering superior performance.

## Depth-Guided Robust and Fast Point Cloud Fusion NeRF for Sparse Input  Views

**Abstract**: Novel-view synthesis with sparse input views is important for real-world
applications like AR/VR and autonomous driving. Recent methods have integrated
depth information into NeRFs for sparse input synthesis, leveraging depth prior
for geometric and spatial understanding. However, most existing works tend to
overlook inaccuracies within depth maps and have low time efficiency. To
address these issues, we propose a depth-guided robust and fast point cloud
fusion NeRF for sparse inputs. We perceive radiance fields as an explicit voxel
grid of features. A point cloud is constructed for each input view,
characterized within the voxel grid using matrices and vectors. We accumulate
the point cloud of each input view to construct the fused point cloud of the
entire scene. Each voxel determines its density and appearance by referring to
the point cloud of the entire scene. Through point cloud fusion and voxel grid
fine-tuning, inaccuracies in depth values are refined or substituted by those
from other views. Moreover, our method can achieve faster reconstruction and
greater compactness through effective vector-matrix decomposition. Experimental
results underline the superior performance and time efficiency of our approach
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

## NeRF-VPT: Learning Novel View Representations with Neural Radiance  Fields via View Prompt Tuning

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have garnered remarkable success in novel view
synthesis. Nonetheless, the task of generating high-quality images for novel
views persists as a critical challenge. While the existing efforts have
exhibited commendable progress, capturing intricate details, enhancing
textures, and achieving superior Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metrics
warrant further focused attention and advancement. In this work, we propose
NeRF-VPT, an innovative method for novel view synthesis to address these
challenges. Our proposed NeRF-VPT employs a cascading view prompt tuning
paradigm, wherein RGB information gained from preceding rendering outcomes
serves as instructive visual prompts for subsequent rendering stages, with the
aspiration that the prior knowledge embedded in the prompts can facilitate the
gradual enhancement of rendered image quality. NeRF-VPT only requires sampling
RGB data from previous stage renderings as priors at each training stage,
without relying on extra guidance or complex techniques. Thus, our NeRF-VPT is
plug-and-play and can be readily integrated into existing methods. By
conducting comparative analyses of our NeRF-VPT against several NeRF-based
approaches on demanding real-scene benchmarks, such as Realistic Synthetic 360,
Real Forward-Facing, Replica dataset, and a user-captured dataset, we
substantiate that our NeRF-VPT significantly elevates baseline performance and
proficiently generates more high-quality novel view images than all the
compared state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the cascading learning of
NeRF-VPT introduces adaptability to scenarios with sparse inputs, resulting in
a significant enhancement of accuracy for sparse-view novel view synthesis. The

**Abstract**: This study presents a novel approach for generating holograms based on the
neural radiance fields (NeRF) technique. Generating three-dimensional (3D) data
is difficult in hologram computation. NeRF is a state-of-the-art technique for
3D light-field reconstruction from 2D images based on volume rendering. The
NeRF can rapidly predict new-view images that do not include a training
dataset. In this study, we constructed a rendering pipeline directly from a 3D
light field generated from 2D images by NeRF for hologram generation using deep
neural networks within a reasonable time. The pipeline comprises three main
components: the NeRF, a depth predictor, and a hologram generator, all
constructed using deep neural networks. The pipeline does not include any
physical calculations. The predicted holograms of a 3D scene viewed from any
direction were computed using the proposed pipeline. The simulation and
experimental results are presented.

## Neural Field Classifiers via Target Encoding and Classification Loss

**Abstract**: Neural field methods have seen great progress in various long-standing tasks
in computer vision and computer graphics, including novel view synthesis and
geometry reconstruction. As existing neural field methods try to predict some
coordinate-based continuous target values, such as RGB for Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF), all of these methods are regression models and are optimized by
some regression loss. However, are regression models really better than
classification models for neural field methods? In this work, we try to visit
this very fundamental but overlooked question for neural fields from a machine
learning perspective. We successfully propose a novel Neural Field Classifier
(NFC) framework which formulates existing neural field methods as
classification tasks rather than regression tasks. The proposed NFC can easily
transform arbitrary Neural Field Regressor (NFR) into its classification
variant via employing a novel Target Encoding module and optimizing a
classification loss. By encoding a continuous regression target into a
high-dimensional discrete encoding, we naturally formulate a multi-label
classification task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the impressive
effectiveness of NFC at the nearly free extra computational costs. Moreover,
NFC also shows robustness to sparse inputs, corrupted images, and dynamic
scenes.

**Abstract**: We present a framework, DISORF, to enable online 3D reconstruction and
visualization of scenes captured by resource-constrained mobile robots and edge
devices. To address the limited compute capabilities of edge devices and
potentially limited network availability, we design a framework that
efficiently distributes computation between the edge device and remote server.
We leverage on-device SLAM systems to generate posed keyframes and transmit
them to remote servers that can perform high quality 3D reconstruction and
visualization at runtime by leveraging NeRF models. We identify a key challenge
with online NeRF training where naive image sampling strategies can lead to
significant degradation in rendering quality. We propose a novel shifted
exponential frame sampling method that addresses this challenge for online NeRF
training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in enabling
high-quality real-time reconstruction and visualization of unknown scenes as
they are captured and streamed from cameras in mobile robots and edge devices.
