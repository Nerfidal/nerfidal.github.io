**Abstract**: We introduce EnerVerse, a comprehensive framework for embodied future space
generation specifically designed for robotic manipulation tasks. EnerVerse
seamlessly integrates convolutional and bidirectional attention mechanisms for
inner-chunk space modeling, ensuring low-level consistency and continuity.
Recognizing the inherent redundancy in video data, we propose a sparse memory
context combined with a chunkwise unidirectional generative paradigm to enable
the generation of infinitely long sequences. To further augment robotic
capabilities, we introduce the Free Anchor View (FAV) space, which provides
flexible perspectives to enhance observation and analysis. The FAV space
mitigates motion modeling ambiguity, removes physical constraints in confined
environments, and significantly improves the robot's generalization and
adaptability across various tasks and settings. To address the prohibitive
costs and labor intensity of acquiring multi-camera observations, we present a
data engine pipeline that integrates a generative model with 4D Gaussian
Splatting (4DGS). This pipeline leverages the generative model's robust
generalization capabilities and the spatial constraints provided by 4DGS,
enabling an iterative enhancement of data quality and diversity, thus creating
a data flywheel effect that effectively narrows the sim-to-real gap. Finally,
our experiments demonstrate that the embodied future space generation prior
substantially enhances policy predictive capabilities, resulting in improved
overall performance, particularly in long-range robotic manipulation tasks.

**Abstract**: We introduce Cloth-Splatting, a method for estimating 3D states of cloth from
RGB images through a prediction-update framework. Cloth-Splatting leverages an
action-conditioned dynamics model for predicting future states and uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to update the predicted states. Our key insight is that
coupling a 3D mesh-based representation with Gaussian Splatting allows us to
define a differentiable map between the cloth state space and the image space.
This enables the use of gradient-based optimization techniques to refine
inaccurate state estimates using only RGB supervision. Our experiments
demonstrate that Cloth-Splatting not only improves state estimation accuracy
over current baselines but also reduces convergence time.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent method for scene
representation and reconstruction, leveraging densely distributed Gaussian
primitives to enable real-time rendering of high-resolution images. While
existing 3DGS methods perform well in scenes with minor view variation, large
view changes in cross-view scenes pose optimization challenges for these
methods. To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-view Gaussian
Splatting method for large-scale scene reconstruction, based on dual-branch
fusion. Our method independently reconstructs models from aerial and ground
views as two independent branches to establish the baselines of Gaussian
distribution, providing reliable priors for cross-view reconstruction during
both initialization and densification. Specifically, a gradient-aware
regularization strategy is introduced to mitigate smoothing issues caused by
significant view disparities. Additionally, a unique Gaussian supplementation
strategy is utilized to incorporate complementary information of dual-branch
into the cross-view model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in novel view
synthesis compared to state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a transformative method in the
field of real-time novel synthesis. Based on 3DGS, recent advancements cope
with large-scale scenes via spatial-based partition strategy to reduce video
memory and optimization time costs. In this work, we introduce a parallel
Gaussian splatting method, termed PG-SAG, which fully exploits semantic cues
for both partitioning and Gaussian kernel optimization, enabling fine-grained
building surface reconstruction of large-scale urban areas without downsampling
the original image resolution. First, the Cross-modal model - Language Segment
Anything is leveraged to segment building masks. Then, the segmented building
regions is grouped into sub-regions according to the visibility check across
registered images. The Gaussian kernels for these sub-regions are optimized in
parallel with masked pixels. In addition, the normal loss is re-formulated for
the detected edges of masks to alleviate the ambiguities in normal vectors on
edges. Finally, to improve the optimization of 3D Gaussians, we introduce a
gradient-constrained balance-load loss that accounts for the complexity of the
corresponding scenes, effectively minimizing the thread waiting time in the
pixel-parallel rendering stage as well as the reconstruction lost. Extensive
experiments are tested on various urban datasets, the results demonstrated the
superior performance of our PG-SAG on building surface reconstruction, compared
to several state-of-the-art 3DGS-based methods. Project

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques have achieved satisfactory 3D scene
representation. Despite their impressive performance, they confront challenges
due to the limitation of structure-from-motion (SfM) methods on acquiring
accurate scene initialization, or the inefficiency of densification strategy.
In this paper, we introduce a novel framework EasySplat to achieve high-quality
3DGS modeling. Instead of using SfM for scene initialization, we employ a novel
method to release the power of large-scale pointmap approaches. Specifically,
we propose an efficient grouping strategy based on view similarity, and use
robust pointmap priors to obtain high-quality point clouds and camera poses for
3D scene initialization. After obtaining a reliable scene structure, we propose
a novel densification approach that adaptively splits Gaussian primitives based
on the average shape of neighboring Gaussian ellipsoids, utilizing KNN scheme.
In this way, the proposed method tackles the limitation on initialization and
optimization, leading to an efficient and accurate 3DGS modeling. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EasySplat outperforms the current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) in handling novel view synthesis.

## Deformable Gaussian Splatting for Efficient and High-Fidelity  Reconstruction of Surgical Scenes

**Abstract**: Efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction of deformable surgical scenes is a
critical yet challenging task. Building on recent advancements in 3D Gaussian
splatting, current methods have seen significant improvements in both
reconstruction quality and rendering speed. However, two major limitations
remain: (1) difficulty in handling irreversible dynamic changes, such as tissue
shearing, which are common in surgical scenes; and (2) the lack of hierarchical
modeling for surgical scene deformation, which reduces rendering speed. To
address these challenges, we introduce EH-SurGS, an efficient and high-fidelity
reconstruction algorithm for deformable surgical scenes. We propose a
deformation modeling approach that incorporates the life cycle of 3D Gaussians,
effectively capturing both regular and irreversible deformations, thus
enhancing reconstruction quality. Additionally, we present an adaptive motion
hierarchy strategy that distinguishes between static and deformable regions
within the surgical scene. This strategy reduces the number of 3D Gaussians
passing through the deformation field, thereby improving rendering speed.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed.
Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity of our
proposed components. We will open-source our code upon acceptance of the paper.
