**Abstract**: Efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction of deformable surgical scenes is a
critical yet challenging task. Building on recent advancements in 3D Gaussian
splatting, current methods have seen significant improvements in both
reconstruction quality and rendering speed. However, two major limitations
remain: (1) difficulty in handling irreversible dynamic changes, such as tissue
shearing, which are common in surgical scenes; and (2) the lack of hierarchical
modeling for surgical scene deformation, which reduces rendering speed. To
address these challenges, we introduce EH-SurGS, an efficient and high-fidelity
reconstruction algorithm for deformable surgical scenes. We propose a
deformation modeling approach that incorporates the life cycle of 3D Gaussians,
effectively capturing both regular and irreversible deformations, thus
enhancing reconstruction quality. Additionally, we present an adaptive motion
hierarchy strategy that distinguishes between static and deformable regions
within the surgical scene. This strategy reduces the number of 3D Gaussians
passing through the deformation field, thereby improving rendering speed.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed.
Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity of our
proposed components. We will open-source our code upon acceptance of the paper.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques have achieved satisfactory 3D scene
representation. Despite their impressive performance, they confront challenges
due to the limitation of structure-from-motion (SfM) methods on acquiring
accurate scene initialization, or the inefficiency of densification strategy.
In this paper, we introduce a novel framework EasySplat to achieve high-quality
3DGS modeling. Instead of using SfM for scene initialization, we employ a novel
method to release the power of large-scale pointmap approaches. Specifically,
we propose an efficient grouping strategy based on view similarity, and use
robust pointmap priors to obtain high-quality point clouds and camera poses for
3D scene initialization. After obtaining a reliable scene structure, we propose
a novel densification approach that adaptively splits Gaussian primitives based
on the average shape of neighboring Gaussian ellipsoids, utilizing KNN scheme.
In this way, the proposed method tackles the limitation on initialization and
optimization, leading to an efficient and accurate 3DGS modeling. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EasySplat outperforms the current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) in handling novel view synthesis.
