**Abstract**: Single-image human reconstruction is vital for digital human modeling
applications but remains an extremely challenging task. Current approaches rely
on generative models to synthesize multi-view images for subsequent 3D
reconstruction and animation. However, directly generating multiple views from
a single human image suffers from geometric inconsistencies, resulting in
issues like fragmented or blurred limbs in the reconstructed models. To tackle
these limitations, we introduce \textbf{HumanDreamer-X}, a novel framework that
integrates multi-view human generation and reconstruction into a unified
pipeline, which significantly enhances the geometric consistency and visual
fidelity of the reconstructed 3D models. In this framework, 3D Gaussian
Splatting serves as an explicit 3D representation to provide initial geometry
and appearance priority. Building upon this foundation, \textbf{HumanFixer} is
trained to restore 3DGS renderings, which guarantee photorealistic results.
Furthermore, we delve into the inherent challenges associated with attention
mechanisms in multi-view human generation, and propose an attention modulation
strategy that effectively enhances geometric details identity consistency
across multi-view. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach markedly
improves generation and reconstruction PSNR quality metrics by 16.45% and
12.65%, respectively, achieving a PSNR of up to 25.62 dB, while also showing
generalization capabilities on in-the-wild data and applicability to various
human reconstruction backbone models.

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a cutting-edge neural network-based
technique for novel view synthesis in 3D reconstruction. However, its
significant computational demands pose challenges for deployment on mobile
devices. While mesh-based NeRF solutions have shown potential in achieving
real-time rendering on mobile platforms, they often fail to deliver
high-quality reconstructions when rendering practical complex scenes.
Additionally, the non-negligible memory overhead caused by pre-computed
intermediate results complicates their practical application. To overcome these
challenges, we present NeRFlex, a resource-aware, high-resolution, real-time
rendering framework for complex scenes on mobile devices. NeRFlex integrates
mobile NeRF rendering with multi-NeRF representations that decompose a scene
into multiple sub-scenes, each represented by an individual NeRF network.
Crucially, NeRFlex considers both memory and computation constraints as
first-class citizens and redesigns the reconstruction process accordingly.
NeRFlex first designs a detail-oriented segmentation module to identify
sub-scenes with high-frequency details. For each NeRF network, a lightweight
profiler, built on domain knowledge, is used to accurately map configurations
to visual quality and memory usage. Based on these insights and the resource
constraints on mobile devices, NeRFlex presents a dynamic programming algorithm
to efficiently determine configurations for all NeRF representations, despite
the NP-hardness of the original decision problem. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets and mobile devices demonstrate that NeRFlex achieves
real-time, high-quality rendering on commercial mobile devices.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in 3D
reconstruction, achieving high-quality results with real-time radiance field
rendering. However, a key challenge is the substantial storage cost:
reconstructing a single scene typically requires millions of Gaussian splats,
each represented by 59 floating-point parameters, resulting in approximately
1~GB of memory. To address this challenge, we propose a compression method by
building separate attribute codebooks and storing only discrete code indices.
Specifically, we employ noise-substituted vector quantization technique to
jointly train the codebooks and model features, ensuring consistency between
gradient descent optimization and parameter discretization. Our method reduces
the memory consumption efficiently (around $45\times$) while maintaining
competitive reconstruction quality on standard 3D benchmark scenes. Experiments
on different codebook sizes show the trade-off between compression ratio and
image quality. Furthermore, the trained compressed model remains fully
compatible with popular 3DGS viewers and enables faster rendering speed, making
it well-suited for practical applications.

**Abstract**: Generating realistic, room-level indoor scenes with semantically plausible
and detailed appearances from in-the-wild images is crucial for various
applications in VR, AR, and robotics. The success of NeRF-based generative
methods indicates a promising direction to address this challenge. However,
unlike their success at the object level, existing scene-level generative
methods require additional information, such as multiple views, depth images,
or semantic guidance, rather than relying solely on RGB images. This is because
NeRF-based methods necessitate prior knowledge of camera poses, which is
challenging to approximate for indoor scenes due to the complexity of defining
alignment and the difficulty of globally estimating poses from a single image,
given the unseen parts behind the camera. To address this challenge, we
redefine global poses within the framework of Local-Pose-Alignment (LPA) -- an
anchor-based multi-local-coordinate system that uses a selected number of
anchors as the roots of these coordinates. Building on this foundation, we
introduce LPA-GAN, a novel NeRF-based generative approach that incorporates
specific modifications to estimate the priors of camera poses under LPA. It
also co-optimizes the pose predictor and scene generation processes. Our
ablation study and comparisons with straightforward extensions of NeRF-based
object generative methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
Furthermore, visual comparisons with other techniques reveal that our method
achieves superior view-to-view consistency and semantic normality.

## ConsDreamer: Advancing Multi-View Consistency for Zero-Shot Text-to-3D  Generation

**Abstract**: Recent advances in zero-shot text-to-3D generation have revolutionized 3D
content creation by enabling direct synthesis from textual descriptions. While
state-of-the-art methods leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting with score distillation
to enhance multi-view rendering through pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models,
they suffer from inherent view biases in T2I priors. These biases lead to
inconsistent 3D generation, particularly manifesting as the multi-face Janus
problem, where objects exhibit conflicting features across views. To address
this fundamental challenge, we propose ConsDreamer, a novel framework that
mitigates view bias by refining both the conditional and unconditional terms in
the score distillation process: (1) a View Disentanglement Module (VDM) that
eliminates viewpoint biases in conditional prompts by decoupling irrelevant
view components and injecting precise camera parameters; and (2) a
similarity-based partial order loss that enforces geometric consistency in the
unconditional term by aligning cosine similarities with azimuth relationships.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsDreamer effectively mitigates the
multi-face Janus problem in text-to-3D generation, outperforming existing
methods in both visual quality and consistency.

**Abstract**: We present MultiNeRF, a 3D watermarking method that embeds multiple uniquely
keyed watermarks within images rendered by a single Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) model, whilst maintaining high visual quality. Our approach extends the
TensoRF NeRF model by incorporating a dedicated watermark grid alongside the
existing geometry and appearance grids. This extension ensures higher watermark
capacity without entangling watermark signals with scene content. We propose a
FiLM-based conditional modulation mechanism that dynamically activates
watermarks based on input identifiers, allowing multiple independent watermarks
to be embedded and extracted without requiring model retraining. MultiNeRF is
validated on the NeRF-Synthetic and LLFF datasets, with statistically
significant improvements in robust capacity without compromising rendering
quality. By generalizing single-watermark NeRF methods into a flexible
multi-watermarking framework, MultiNeRF provides a scalable solution for 3D
content. attribution.

**Abstract**: We present MonoGS++, a novel fast and accurate Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM) method that leverages 3D Gaussian representations and operates
solely on RGB inputs. While previous 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based methods
largely depended on depth sensors, our approach reduces the hardware dependency
and only requires RGB input, leveraging online visual odometry (VO) to generate
sparse point clouds in real-time. To reduce redundancy and enhance the quality
of 3D scene reconstruction, we implemented a series of methodological
enhancements in 3D Gaussian mapping. Firstly, we introduced dynamic 3D Gaussian
insertion to avoid adding redundant Gaussians in previously well-reconstructed
areas. Secondly, we introduced clarity-enhancing Gaussian densification module
and planar regularization to handle texture-less areas and flat surfaces
better. We achieved precise camera tracking results both on the synthetic
Replica and real-world TUM-RGBD datasets, comparable to those of the
state-of-the-art. Additionally, our method realized a significant 5.57x
improvement in frames per second (fps) over the previous state-of-the-art,
MonoGS.

**Abstract**: Three-dimensional imaging through scattering media is important in medical
science and astronomy. We propose a digital-twin imaging method based on
Gaussian splatting to observe an object behind a scattering medium. A digital
twin model built through data assimilation, emulates the behavior of objects
and environmental changes in a virtual space. By constructing a digital twin
using point clouds composed of Gaussians and simulating the scattering process
through the convolution of a point spread function, three-dimensional objects
behind a scattering medium can be reproduced as a digital twin. In this study,
a high-contrast digital twin reproducing a three-dimensional object was
successfully constructed from degraded images, assuming that data were acquired
from wavefronts disturbed by a scattering medium. This technique reproduces
objects by integrating data processing with image measurements.

## 3DBonsai: Structure-Aware Bonsai Modeling Using Conditioned 3D Gaussian  Splatting

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in text-to-3D generation have shown remarkable results by
leveraging 3D priors in combination with 2D diffusion. However, previous
methods utilize 3D priors that lack detailed and complex structural
information, limiting them to generating simple objects and presenting
challenges for creating intricate structures such as bonsai. In this paper, we
propose 3DBonsai, a novel text-to-3D framework for generating 3D bonsai with
complex structures. Technically, we first design a trainable 3D space
colonization algorithm to produce bonsai structures, which are then enhanced
through random sampling and point cloud augmentation to serve as the 3D
Gaussian priors. We introduce two bonsai generation pipelines with distinct
structural levels: fine structure conditioned generation, which initializes 3D
Gaussians using a 3D structure prior to produce detailed and complex bonsai,
and coarse structure conditioned generation, which employs a multi-view
structure consistency module to align 2D and 3D structures. Moreover, we have
compiled a unified 2D and 3D Chinese-style bonsai dataset. Our experimental
results demonstrate that 3DBonsai significantly outperforms existing methods,
providing a new benchmark for structure-aware 3D bonsai generation.

**Abstract**: Scene-level 3D generation is a challenging research topic, with most existing
methods generating only partial scenes and offering limited navigational
freedom. We introduce WorldPrompter, a novel generative pipeline for
synthesizing traversable 3D scenes from text prompts. We leverage panoramic
videos as an intermediate representation to model the 360{\deg} details of a
scene. WorldPrompter incorporates a conditional 360{\deg} panoramic video
generator, capable of producing a 128-frame video that simulates a person
walking through and capturing a virtual environment. The resulting video is
then reconstructed as Gaussian splats by a fast feedforward 3D reconstructor,
enabling a true walkable experience within the 3D scene. Experiments
demonstrate that our panoramic video generation model achieves convincing view
consistency across frames, enabling high-quality panoramic Gaussian splat
reconstruction and facilitating traversal over an area of the scene.
Qualitative and quantitative results also show it outperforms the
state-of-the-art 360{\deg} video generators and 3D scene generation models.

**Abstract**: We present UAVTwin, a method for creating digital twins from real-world
environments and facilitating data augmentation for training downstream models
embedded in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, our approach focuses
on synthesizing foreground components, such as various human instances in
motion within complex scene backgrounds, from UAV perspectives. This is
achieved by integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reconstructing
backgrounds along with controllable synthetic human models that display diverse
appearances and actions in multiple poses. To the best of our knowledge,
UAVTwin is the first approach for UAV-based perception that is capable of
generating high-fidelity digital twins based on 3DGS. The proposed work
significantly enhances downstream models through data augmentation for
real-world environments with multiple dynamic objects and significant
appearance variations-both of which typically introduce artifacts in 3DGS-based
modeling. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel appearance modeling
strategy and a mask refinement module to enhance the training of 3D Gaussian
Splatting. We demonstrate the high quality of neural rendering by achieving a
1.23 dB improvement in PSNR compared to recent methods. Furthermore, we
validate the effectiveness of data augmentation by showing a 2.5% to 13.7%
improvement in mAP for the human detection task.

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) have achieved impressive results in real-time 3D reconstruction
and novel view synthesis. However, these methods struggle in large-scale,
unconstrained environments where sparse and uneven input coverage, transient
occlusions, appearance variability, and inconsistent camera settings lead to
degraded quality. We propose GS-Diff, a novel 3DGS framework guided by a
multi-view diffusion model to address these limitations. By generating
pseudo-observations conditioned on multi-view inputs, our method transforms
under-constrained 3D reconstruction problems into well-posed ones, enabling
robust optimization even with sparse data. GS-Diff further integrates several
enhancements, including appearance embedding, monocular depth priors, dynamic
object modeling, anisotropy regularization, and advanced rasterization
techniques, to tackle geometric and photometric challenges in real-world
settings. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that GS-Diff consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by significant margins.

**Abstract**: The development of large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view
synthesis methods mostly rely on datasets comprising perspective images with
narrow fields of view (FoV). While effective for small-scale scenes, these
datasets require large image sets and extensive structure-from-motion (SfM)
processing, limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a fisheye image
dataset tailored for scene reconstruction tasks. Using dual 200-degree fisheye
lenses, our dataset provides full 360-degree coverage of 5 indoor and 5 outdoor
scenes. Each scene has sparse SfM point clouds and precise LIDAR-derived dense
point clouds that can be used as geometric ground-truth, enabling robust
benchmarking under challenging conditions such as occlusions and reflections.
While the baseline experiments focus on vanilla Gaussian Splatting and NeRF
based Nerfacto methods, the dataset supports diverse approaches for scene
reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and image-based rendering.

## Toward Real-world BEV Perception: Depth Uncertainty Estimation via  Gaussian Splatting

**Abstract**: Bird's-eye view (BEV) perception has gained significant attention because it
provides a unified representation to fuse multiple view images and enables a
wide range of down-stream autonomous driving tasks, such as forecasting and
planning. Recent state-of-the-art models utilize projection-based methods which
formulate BEV perception as query learning to bypass explicit depth estimation.
While we observe promising advancements in this paradigm, they still fall short
of real-world applications because of the lack of uncertainty modeling and
expensive computational requirement. In this work, we introduce GaussianLSS, a
novel uncertainty-aware BEV perception framework that revisits
unprojection-based methods, specifically the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) paradigm,
and enhances them with depth un-certainty modeling. GaussianLSS represents
spatial dispersion by learning a soft depth mean and computing the variance of
the depth distribution, which implicitly captures object extents. We then
transform the depth distribution into 3D Gaussians and rasterize them to
construct uncertainty-aware BEV features. We evaluate GaussianLSS on the
nuScenes dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to
unprojection-based methods. In particular, it provides significant advantages
in speed, running 2.5x faster, and in memory efficiency, using 0.3x less memory
compared to projection-based methods, while achieving competitive performance
with only a 0.4% IoU difference.

**Abstract**: Modeling animatable human avatars from monocular or multi-view videos has
been widely studied, with recent approaches leveraging neural radiance fields
(NeRFs) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieving impressive results in
novel-view and novel-pose synthesis. However, existing methods often struggle
to accurately capture the dynamics of loose clothing, as they primarily rely on
global pose conditioning or static per-frame representations, leading to
oversmoothing and temporal inconsistencies in non-rigid regions. To address
this, We propose RealityAvatar, an efficient framework for high-fidelity
digital human modeling, specifically targeting loosely dressed avatars. Our
method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to capture complex clothing deformations
and motion dynamics while ensuring geometric consistency. By incorporating a
motion trend module and a latentbone encoder, we explicitly model
pose-dependent deformations and temporal variations in clothing behavior.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in capturing fine-grained clothing deformations and motion-driven
shape variations. Our method significantly enhances structural fidelity and
perceptual quality in dynamic human reconstruction, particularly in non-rigid
regions, while achieving better consistency across temporal frames.

**Abstract**: Recently single-view 3D generation via Gaussian splatting has emerged and
developed quickly. They learn 3D Gaussians from 2D RGB images generated from
pre-trained multi-view diffusion (MVD) models, and have shown a promising
avenue for 3D generation through a single image. Despite the current progress,
these methods still suffer from the inconsistency jointly caused by the
geometric ambiguity in the 2D images, and the lack of structure of 3D
Gaussians, leading to distorted and blurry 3D object generation. In this paper,
we propose to fix these issues by GS-RGBN, a new RGBN-volume Gaussian
Reconstruction Model designed to generate high-fidelity 3D objects from
single-view images. Our key insight is a structured 3D representation can
simultaneously mitigate the afore-mentioned two issues. To this end, we propose
a novel hybrid Voxel-Gaussian representation, where a 3D voxel representation
contains explicit 3D geometric information, eliminating the geometric ambiguity
from 2D images. It also structures Gaussians during learning so that the
optimization tends to find better local optima. Our 3D voxel representation is
obtained by a fusion module that aligns RGB features and surface normal
features, both of which can be estimated from 2D images. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of our methods over prior works in terms of
high-quality reconstruction results, robust generalization, and good
efficiency.

**Abstract**: Capturing high-quality photographs under diverse real-world lighting
conditions is challenging, as both natural lighting (e.g., low-light) and
camera exposure settings (e.g., exposure time) significantly impact image
quality. This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-view scenarios, where
variations in lighting and image signal processor (ISP) settings across
viewpoints introduce photometric inconsistencies. Such lighting degradations
and view-dependent variations pose substantial challenges to novel view
synthesis (NVS) frameworks based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). To address this, we introduce Luminance-GS, a novel
approach to achieving high-quality novel view synthesis results under diverse
challenging lighting conditions using 3DGS. By adopting per-view color matrix
mapping and view-adaptive curve adjustments, Luminance-GS achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across various lighting conditions -- including
low-light, overexposure, and varying exposure -- while not altering the
original 3DGS explicit representation. Compared to previous NeRF- and
3DGS-based baselines, Luminance-GS provides real-time rendering speed with
improved reconstruction quality.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting shows great potential in reconstructing photo-realistic
3D scenes. However, these methods typically bake illumination into their
representations, limiting their use for physically-based rendering and scene
editing. Although recent inverse rendering approaches aim to decompose scenes
into material and lighting components, they often rely on simplifying
assumptions that fail when editing. We present a novel approach that enables
efficient global illumination for 3D Gaussians Splatting through screen-space
ray tracing. Our key insight is that a substantial amount of indirect light can
be traced back to surfaces visible within the current view frustum. Leveraging
this observation, we augment the direct shading computed by 3D Gaussians with
Monte-Carlo screen-space ray-tracing to capture one-bounce indirect
illumination. In this way, our method enables realistic global illumination
without sacrificing the computational efficiency and editability benefits of 3D
Gaussians. Through experiments, we show that the screen-space approximation we
utilize allows for indirect illumination and supports real-time rendering and
editing. Code, data, and models will be made available at our project page:

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) proposes an efficient solution for novel view

less complex than other solutions such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), there
are still some challenges building smaller models without sacrificing quality.
In this study, we perform a careful analysis of 3DGS training process and
propose a new optimization methodology. Our Better Optimized Gaussian Splatting
(BOGausS) solution is able to generate models up to ten times lighter than the
original 3DGS with no quality degradation, thus significantly boosting the
performance of Gaussian Splatting compared to the state of the art.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian splatting enables high-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) at
real-time frame rates. However, its quality drops sharply as we depart from the
training views. Thus, dense captures are needed to match the high-quality
expectations of some applications, e.g. Virtual Reality (VR). However, such
dense captures are very laborious and expensive to obtain. Existing works have
explored using 2D generative models to alleviate this requirement by
distillation or generating additional training views. These methods are often
conditioned only on a handful of reference input views and thus do not fully
exploit the available 3D information, leading to inconsistent generation
results and reconstruction artifacts. To tackle this problem, we propose a
multi-view, flow matching model that learns a flow to connect novel view
renderings from possibly sparse reconstructions to renderings that we expect
from dense reconstructions. This enables augmenting scene captures with novel,
generated views to improve reconstruction quality. Our model is trained on a
novel dataset of 3.6M image pairs and can process up to 45 views at 540x960
resolution (91K tokens) on one H100 GPU in a single forward pass. Our pipeline
consistently improves NVS in sparse- and dense-view scenarios, leading to
higher-quality reconstructions than prior works across multiple, widely-used
NVS benchmarks.

**Abstract**: With Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) arising as a powerful 3D representation,
research has investigated its various downstream tasks, including inpainting
NeRFs with 2D images. Despite successful efforts addressing the view
consistency and geometry quality, prior methods yet suffer from occlusion in
NeRF inpainting tasks, where 2D prior is severely limited in forming a faithful
reconstruction of the scene to inpaint.
  To address this, we propose a novel approach that enables cross-view
information sharing during knowledge distillation from a diffusion model,
effectively propagating occluded information across limited views.
Additionally, to align the distillation direction across multiple sampled
views, we apply a grid-based denoising strategy and incorporate additional
rendered views to enhance cross-view consistency. To assess our approach's
capability of handling occlusion cases, we construct a dataset consisting of
challenging scenes with severe occlusion, in addition to existing datasets.
Compared with baseline methods, our method demonstrates better performance in
cross-view consistency and faithfulness in reconstruction, while preserving
high rendering quality and fidelity.

**Abstract**: We introduce DD3G, a formulation that Distills a multi-view Diffusion model
(MV-DM) into a 3D Generator using gaussian splatting. DD3G compresses and
integrates extensive visual and spatial geometric knowledge from the MV-DM by
simulating its ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory, ensuring the
distilled generator generalizes better than those trained solely on 3D data.
Unlike previous amortized optimization approaches, we align the MV-DM and 3D
generator representation spaces to transfer the teacher's probabilistic flow to
the student, thus avoiding inconsistencies in optimization objectives caused by
probabilistic sampling. The introduction of probabilistic flow and the coupling
of various attributes in 3D Gaussians introduce challenges in the generation
process. To tackle this, we propose PEPD, a generator consisting of Pattern
Extraction and Progressive Decoding phases, which enables efficient fusion of
probabilistic flow and converts a single image into 3D Gaussians within 0.06
seconds. Furthermore, to reduce knowledge loss and overcome sparse-view
supervision, we design a joint optimization objective that ensures the quality
of generated samples through explicit supervision and implicit verification.
Leveraging existing 2D generation models, we compile 120k high-quality RGBA
images for distillation. Experiments on synthetic and public datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our project is available at:

**Abstract**: Reconstructing and decomposing dynamic urban scenes is crucial for autonomous
driving, urban planning, and scene editing. However, existing methods fail to
perform instance-aware decomposition without manual annotations, which is
crucial for instance-level scene editing.We propose UnIRe, a 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) based approach that decomposes a scene into a static
background and individual dynamic instances using only RGB images and LiDAR
point clouds. At its core, we introduce 4D superpoints, a novel representation
that clusters multi-frame LiDAR points in 4D space, enabling unsupervised
instance separation based on spatiotemporal correlations. These 4D superpoints
serve as the foundation for our decomposed 4D initialization, i.e., providing
spatial and temporal initialization to train a dynamic 3DGS for arbitrary
dynamic classes without requiring bounding boxes or object
templates.Furthermore, we introduce a smoothness regularization strategy in
both 2D and 3D space, further improving the temporal stability.Experiments on
benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods in
decomposed dynamic scene reconstruction while enabling accurate and flexible
instance-level editing, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications.

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have become a popular 3D reconstruction
approach in recent years. While they produce high-quality results, they also
demand lengthy training times, often spanning days. This paper studies neural
pruning as a strategy to address these concerns. We compare pruning approaches,
including uniform sampling, importance-based methods, and coreset-based
techniques, to reduce the model size and speed up training. Our findings show
that coreset-driven pruning can achieve a 50% reduction in model size and a 35%
speedup in training, with only a slight decrease in accuracy. These results
suggest that pruning can be an effective method for improving the efficiency of
NeRF models in resource-limited settings.

**Abstract**: Radar is an important sensor for autonomous driving (AD) systems due to its
robustness to adverse weather and different lighting conditions. Novel view
synthesis using neural radiance fields (NeRFs) has recently received
considerable attention in AD due to its potential to enable efficient testing
and validation but remains unexplored for radar point clouds. In this paper, we
present NeuRadar, a NeRF-based model that jointly generates radar point clouds,
camera images, and lidar point clouds. We explore set-based object detection
methods such as DETR, and propose an encoder-based solution grounded in the
NeRF geometry for improved generalizability. We propose both a deterministic
and a probabilistic point cloud representation to accurately model the radar
behavior, with the latter being able to capture radar's stochastic behavior. We
achieve realistic reconstruction results for two automotive datasets,
establishing a baseline for NeRF-based radar point cloud simulation models. In
addition, we release radar data for ZOD's Sequences and Drives to enable
further research in this field. To encourage further development of radar
NeRFs, we release the source code for NeuRadar.

**Abstract**: Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has gained considerable attentions in
the field of novel view synthesis due to its fast performance while yielding
the excellent image quality. However, 3DGS in sparse-view settings (e.g.,
three-view inputs) often faces with the problem of overfitting to training
views, which significantly drops the visual quality of novel view images. Many
existing approaches have tackled this issue by using strong priors, such as 2D
generative contextual information and external depth signals. In contrast, this
paper introduces a prior-free method, so-called DropGaussian, with simple
changes in 3D Gaussian splatting. Specifically, we randomly remove Gaussians
during the training process in a similar way of dropout, which allows
non-excluded Gaussians to have larger gradients while improving their
visibility. This makes the remaining Gaussians to contribute more to the
optimization process for rendering with sparse input views. Such simple
operation effectively alleviates the overfitting problem and enhances the
quality of novel view synthesis. By simply applying DropGaussian to the
original 3DGS framework, we can achieve the competitive performance with
existing prior-based 3DGS methods in sparse-view settings of benchmark datasets
without any additional complexity. The code and model are publicly available
at: https://github.com/DCVL-3D/DropGaussian release.

## Monocular and Generalizable Gaussian Talking Head Animation

**Abstract**: In this work, we introduce Monocular and Generalizable Gaussian Talking Head
Animation (MGGTalk), which requires monocular datasets and generalizes to
unseen identities without personalized re-training. Compared with previous 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods that requires elusive multi-view datasets or
tedious personalized learning/inference, MGGtalk enables more practical and
broader applications. However, in the absence of multi-view and personalized
training data, the incompleteness of geometric and appearance information poses
a significant challenge. To address these challenges, MGGTalk explores depth
information to enhance geometric and facial symmetry characteristics to
supplement both geometric and appearance features. Initially, based on the
pixel-wise geometric information obtained from depth estimation, we incorporate
symmetry operations and point cloud filtering techniques to ensure a complete
and precise position parameter for 3DGS. Subsequently, we adopt a two-stage
strategy with symmetric priors for predicting the remaining 3DGS parameters. We
begin by predicting Gaussian parameters for the visible facial regions of the
source image. These parameters are subsequently utilized to improve the
prediction of Gaussian parameters for the non-visible regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MGGTalk surpasses previous state-of-the-art
methods, achieving superior performance across various metrics.

## Scene4U: Hierarchical Layered 3D Scene Reconstruction from Single  Panoramic Image for Your Immerse Exploration

**Abstract**: The reconstruction of immersive and realistic 3D scenes holds significant
practical importance in various fields of computer vision and computer
graphics. Typically, immersive and realistic scenes should be free from
obstructions by dynamic objects, maintain global texture consistency, and allow
for unrestricted exploration. The current mainstream methods for image-driven
scene construction involves iteratively refining the initial image using a
moving virtual camera to generate the scene. However, previous methods struggle
with visual discontinuities due to global texture inconsistencies under varying
camera poses, and they frequently exhibit scene voids caused by
foreground-background occlusions. To this end, we propose a novel layered 3D
scene reconstruction framework from panoramic image, named Scene4U.
Specifically, Scene4U integrates an open-vocabulary segmentation model with a
large language model to decompose a real panorama into multiple layers. Then,
we employs a layered repair module based on diffusion model to restore occluded
regions using visual cues and depth information, generating a hierarchical
representation of the scene. The multi-layer panorama is then initialized as a
3D Gaussian Splatting representation, followed by layered optimization, which
ultimately produces an immersive 3D scene with semantic and structural
consistency that supports free exploration. Scene4U outperforms
state-of-the-art method, improving by 24.24% in LPIPS and 24.40% in BRISQUE,
while also achieving the fastest training speed. Additionally, to demonstrate
the robustness of Scene4U and allow users to experience immersive scenes from
various landmarks, we build WorldVista3D dataset for 3D scene reconstruction,
which contains panoramic images of globally renowned sites. The implementation
code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/Scene4U .

## Robust LiDAR-Camera Calibration with 2D Gaussian Splatting

**Abstract**: LiDAR-camera systems have become increasingly popular in robotics recently. A
critical and initial step in integrating the LiDAR and camera data is the
calibration of the LiDAR-camera system. Most existing calibration methods rely
on auxiliary target objects, which often involve complex manual operations,
whereas targetless methods have yet to achieve practical effectiveness.
Recognizing that 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) can reconstruct geometric
information from camera image sequences, we propose a calibration method that
estimates LiDAR-camera extrinsic parameters using geometric constraints. The
proposed method begins by reconstructing colorless 2DGS using LiDAR point
clouds. Subsequently, we update the colors of the Gaussian splats by minimizing
the photometric loss. The extrinsic parameters are optimized during this
process. Additionally, we address the limitations of the photometric loss by
incorporating the reprojection and triangulation losses, thereby enhancing the
calibration robustness and accuracy.

**Abstract**: We present a novel approach, termed ADGaussian, for generalizable street
scene reconstruction. The proposed method enables high-quality rendering from
single-view input. Unlike prior Gaussian Splatting methods that primarily focus
on geometry refinement, we emphasize the importance of joint optimization of
image and depth features for accurate Gaussian prediction. To this end, we
first incorporate sparse LiDAR depth as an additional input modality,
formulating the Gaussian prediction process as a joint learning framework of
visual information and geometric clue. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal
feature matching strategy coupled with a multi-scale Gaussian decoding model to
enhance the joint refinement of multi-modal features, thereby enabling
efficient multi-modal Gaussian learning. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale autonomous driving datasets, Waymo and KITTI, demonstrate that our
ADGaussian achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits superior
zero-shot generalization capabilities in novel-view shifting.
