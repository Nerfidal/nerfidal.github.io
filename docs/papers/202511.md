**Abstract**: The recent introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced novel view synthesis. Several studies have further improved the rendering quality of 3DGS, yet they still exhibit noticeable visual discrepancies when synthesizing views at sampling rates unseen during training. Specifically, they suffer from (i) erosion-induced blurring artifacts when zooming in and (ii) dilation-induced staircase artifacts when zooming out. We speculate that these artifacts arise from the fundamental limitation of the alpha blending adopted in 3DGS methods. Instead of the conventional alpha blending that computes alpha and transmittance as scalar quantities over a pixel, we propose to replace it with our novel Gaussian Blending that treats alpha and transmittance as spatially varying distributions. Thus, transmittances can be updated considering the spatial distribution of alpha values across the pixel area, allowing nearby background splats to contribute to the final rendering. Our Gaussian Blending maintains real-time rendering speed and requires no additional memory cost, while being easily integrated as a drop-in replacement into existing 3DGS-based or other NVS frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Gaussian Blending effectively captures fine details at various sampling rates unseen during training, consistently outperforming existing novel view synthesis models across both unseen and seen sampling rates.

**Abstract**: Intraoral 3D reconstruction is fundamental to digital orthodontics, yet conventional methods like intraoral scanning are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which typically relies on sparse smartphone imagery. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract**: This paper introduces Gaussian Spatial Transport (GST), a novel framework that leverages Gaussian splatting to facilitate transport from the probability measure in the image coordinate space to the annotation map. We propose a Gaussian splatting-based method to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence, which is then used to compute a transport plan derived from Bayesian probability. To integrate the resulting transport plan into standard network optimization in typical computer vision tasks, we derive a loss function that measures discrepancy after transport. Extensive experiments on representative computer vision tasks, including crowd counting and landmark detection, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to conventional optimal transport schemes, GST eliminates iterative transport plan computation during training, significantly improving efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/infinite0522/GST.

**Abstract**: This paper focuses on a challenging setting of simultaneously modeling geometry and appearance of hand-object interaction scenes without any object priors. We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction.

**Abstract**: We introduce a highly expressive class of function approximators called Splat Regression Models. Model outputs are mixtures of heterogeneous and anisotropic bump functions, termed splats, each weighted by an output vector. The power of splat modeling lies in its ability to locally adjust the scale and direction of each splat, achieving both high interpretability and accuracy. Fitting splat models reduces to optimization over the space of mixing measures, which can be implemented using Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flows. As a byproduct, we recover the popular Gaussian Splatting methodology as a special case, providing a unified theoretical framework for this state-of-the-art technique that clearly disambiguates the inverse problem, the model, and the optimization algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting models and algorithms constitute a flexible and promising approach for solving diverse approximation, estimation, and inverse problems involving low-dimensional data.

**Abstract**: Recent trends in SLAM and visual navigation have embraced 3D Gaussians as the preferred scene representation, highlighting the importance of estimating camera poses from a single image using a pre-built Gaussian model. However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

**Abstract**: Despite recent advancements in neural 3D reconstruction, the dependence on dense multi-view captures restricts their broader applicability. Additionally, 3D scene generation is vital for advancing embodied AI and world models, which depend on diverse, high-quality scenes for learning and evaluation. In this work, we propose Gen3d, a novel method for generation of high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes from a single image. After the initial point cloud is created by lifting the RGBD image, Gen3d maintains and expands its world model. The 3D scene is finalized through optimizing a Gaussian splatting representation. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of our method in generating a world model and Synthesizing high-fidelity and consistent novel views.

**Abstract**: We present Gaussian See, Gaussian Do, a novel approach for semantic 3D motion transfer from multiview video. Our method enables rig-free, cross-category motion transfer between objects with semantically meaningful correspondence. Building on implicit motion transfer techniques, we extract motion embeddings from source videos via condition inversion, apply them to rendered frames of static target shapes, and use the resulting videos to supervise dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach introduces an anchor-based view-aware motion embedding mechanism, ensuring cross-view consistency and accelerating convergence, along with a robust 4D reconstruction pipeline that consolidates noisy supervision videos. We establish the first benchmark for semantic 3D motion transfer and demonstrate superior motion fidelity and structural consistency compared to adapted baselines.

## Silhouette-to-Contour Registration: Aligning Intraoral Scan Models with Cephalometric Radiographs

| 2025-11-18 | Yiyi Miao, Taoyu Wu, Ji Jiang, Tong Chen, Zhe Tang, Zhengyong Jiang, Angelos Stefanidis, Limin Yu, Jionglong Su | cs.CV | [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14343v1){: .btn .btn-green } |

**Abstract**: Reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scan (IOS) models and lateral cephalometric radiographs is critical for orthodontic diagnosis, yet conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle under real clinical conditions, where cephalograms exhibit projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation. These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.

## Gaussian Splatting-based Low-Rank Tensor Representation for Multi-Dimensional Image Recovery

**Abstract**: Tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) is a promising tool for multi-dimensional image representation, which decomposes a multi-dimensional image into a latent tensor and an accompanying transform matrix. However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery demonstrate that GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

**Abstract**: Household tidying is an important application area, yet current benchmarks neither model user preferences nor support mobility, and they generalize poorly, making it hard to comprehensively assess integrated language-to-action capabilities. To address this, we propose RoboTidy, a unified benchmark for language-guided household tidying that supports Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and Vision-Language-Navigation (VLN) training and evaluation. RoboTidy provides 500 photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) household scenes (covering 500 objects and containers) with collisions, formulates tidying as an "Action (Object, Container)" list, and supplies 6.4k high-quality manipulation demonstration trajectories and 1.5k naviagtion trajectories to support both few-shot and large-scale training. We also deploy RoboTidy in the real world for object tidying, establishing an end-to-end benchmark for household tidying. RoboTidy offers a scalable platform and bridges a key gap in embodied AI by enabling holistic and realistic evaluation of language-guided robots.

## IBGS: Image-Based Gaussian Splatting

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a fast, high-quality method for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects. Experiments on standard NVS benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality, without increasing the storage footprint.

**Abstract**: Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

## SymGS : Leveraging Local Symmetries for 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a transformative technique in novel view synthesis, primarily due to its high rendering speed and photorealistic fidelity. However, its memory footprint scales rapidly with scene complexity, often reaching several gigabytes. Existing methods address this issue by introducing compression strategies that exploit primitive-level redundancy through similarity detection and quantization. We aim to surpass the compression limits of such methods by incorporating symmetry-aware techniques, specifically targeting mirror symmetries to eliminate redundant primitives. We propose a novel compression framework, SymGS, introducing learnable mirrors into the scene, thereby eliminating local and global reflective redundancies for compression. Our framework functions as a plug-and-play enhancement to state-of-the-art compression methods, (e.g. HAC) to achieve further compression. Compared to HAC, we achieve $1.66 \times$ compression across benchmark datasets (upto $3\times$ on large-scale scenes). On an average, SymGS enables $\bf{108\times}$ compression of a 3DGS scene, while preserving rendering quality. The project page and supplementary can be found at symgs.github.io

## Beyond Darkness: Thermal-Supervised 3D Gaussian Splatting for Low-Light Novel View Synthesis

**Abstract**: Under extremely low-light conditions, novel view synthesis (NVS) faces severe degradation in terms of geometry, color consistency, and radiometric stability. Standard 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) pipelines fail when applied directly to underexposed inputs, as independent enhancement across views causes illumination inconsistencies and geometric distortion. To address this, we present DTGS, a unified framework that tightly couples Retinex-inspired illumination decomposition with thermal-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for illumination-invariant reconstruction. Unlike prior approaches that treat enhancement as a pre-processing step, DTGS performs joint optimization across enhancement, geometry, and thermal supervision through a cyclic enhancement-reconstruction mechanism. A thermal supervisory branch stabilizes both color restoration and geometry learning by dynamically balancing enhancement, structural, and thermal losses. Moreover, a Retinex-based decomposition module embedded within the 3DGS loop provides physically interpretable reflectance-illumination separation, ensuring consistent color and texture across viewpoints. To evaluate our method, we construct RGBT-LOW, a new multi-view low-light thermal dataset capturing severe illumination degradation. Extensive experiments show that DTGS significantly outperforms existing low-light enhancement and 3D reconstruction baselines, achieving superior radiometric consistency, geometric fidelity, and color stability under extreme illumination.

**Abstract**: We introduce GS-Light, an efficient, textual position-aware pipeline for text-guided relighting of 3D scenes represented via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). GS-Light implements a training-free extension of a single-input diffusion model to handle multi-view inputs. Given a user prompt that may specify lighting direction, color, intensity, or reference objects, we employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to parse the prompt into lighting priors. Using off-the-shelf estimators for geometry and semantics (depth, surface normals, and semantic segmentation), we fuse these lighting priors with view-geometry constraints to compute illumination maps and generate initial latent codes for each view. These meticulously derived init latents guide the diffusion model to generate relighting outputs that more accurately reflect user expectations, especially in terms of lighting direction. By feeding multi-view rendered images, along with the init latents, into our multi-view relighting model, we produce high-fidelity, artistically relit images. Finally, we fine-tune the 3DGS scene with the relit appearance to obtain a fully relit 3D scene. We evaluate GS-Light on both indoor and outdoor scenes, comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines including per-view relighting, video relighting, and scene editing methods. Using quantitative metrics (multi-view consistency, imaging quality, aesthetic score, semantic similarity, etc.) and qualitative assessment (user studies), GS-Light demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines. Code and assets will be made available upon publication.

**Abstract**: Lightweight building surface models are crucial for digital city, navigation, and fast geospatial analytics, yet conventional multi-view geometry pipelines remain cumbersome and quality-sensitive due to their reliance on dense reconstruction, meshing, and subsequent simplification. This work presents SF-Recon, a method that directly reconstructs lightweight building surfaces from multi-view images without post-hoc mesh simplification. We first train an initial 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) field to obtain a view-consistent representation. Building structure is then distilled by a normal-gradient-guided Gaussian optimization that selects primitives aligned with roof and wall boundaries, followed by multi-view edge-consistency pruning to enhance structural sharpness and suppress non-structural artifacts without external supervision. Finally, a multi-view depth-constrained Delaunay triangulation converts the structured Gaussian field into a lightweight, structurally faithful building mesh. Based on a proposed SF dataset, the experimental results demonstrate that our SF-Recon can directly reconstruct lightweight building models from multi-view imagery, achieving substantially fewer faces and vertices while maintaining computational efficiency.

**Abstract**: We propose Transmission-Reflection Gaussians (TR-Gaussians), a novel 3D-Gaussian-based representation for high-fidelity rendering of planar transmission and reflection, which are ubiquitous in indoor scenes. Our method combines 3D Gaussians with learnable reflection planes that explicitly model the glass planes with view-dependent reflectance strengths. Real scenes and transmission components are modeled by 3D Gaussians and the reflection components are modeled by the mirrored Gaussians with respect to the reflection plane. The transmission and reflection components are blended according to a Fresnel-based, view-dependent weighting scheme, allowing for faithful synthesis of complex appearance effects under varying viewpoints. To effectively optimize TR-Gaussians, we develop a multi-stage optimization framework incorporating color and geometry constraints and an opacity perturbation mechanism. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate that TR-Gaussians achieve real-time, high-fidelity novel view synthesis in scenes with planar transmission and reflection, and outperform state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.

**Abstract**: We propose PFAvatar (Pose-Fusion Avatar), a new method that reconstructs high-quality 3D avatars from Outfit of the Day(OOTD) photos, which exhibit diverse poses, occlusions, and complex backgrounds. Our method consists of two stages: (1) fine-tuning a pose-aware diffusion model from few-shot OOTD examples and (2) distilling a 3D avatar represented by a neural radiance field (NeRF). In the first stage, unlike previous methods that segment images into assets (e.g., garments, accessories) for 3D assembly, which is prone to inconsistency, we avoid decomposition and directly model the full-body appearance. By integrating a pre-trained ControlNet for pose estimation and a novel Condition Prior Preservation Loss (CPPL), our method enables end-to-end learning of fine details while mitigating language drift in few-shot training. Our method completes personalization in just 5 minutes, achieving a 48x speed-up compared to previous approaches. In the second stage, we introduce a NeRF-based avatar representation optimized by canonical SMPL-X space sampling and Multi-Resolution 3D-SDS. Compared to mesh-based representations that suffer from resolution-dependent discretization and erroneous occluded geometry, our continuous radiance field can preserve high-frequency textures (e.g., hair) and handle occlusions correctly through transmittance. Experiments demonstrate that PFAvatar outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction fidelity, detail preservation, and robustness to occlusions/truncations, advancing practical 3D avatar generation from real-world OOTD albums. In addition, the reconstructed 3D avatar supports downstream applications such as virtual try-on, animation, and human video reenactment, further demonstrating the versatility and practical value of our approach.

## GUIDE: Gaussian Unified Instance Detection for Enhanced Obstacle Perception in Autonomous Driving

**Abstract**: In the realm of autonomous driving, accurately detecting surrounding obstacles is crucial for effective decision-making. Traditional methods primarily rely on 3D bounding boxes to represent these obstacles, which often fail to capture the complexity of irregularly shaped, real-world objects. To overcome these limitations, we present GUIDE, a novel framework that utilizes 3D Gaussians for instance detection and occupancy prediction. Unlike conventional occupancy prediction methods, GUIDE also offers robust tracking capabilities. Our framework employs a sparse representation strategy, using Gaussian-to-Voxel Splatting to provide fine-grained, instance-level occupancy data without the computational demands associated with dense voxel grids. Experimental validation on the nuScenes dataset demonstrates GUIDE's performance, with an instance occupancy mAP of 21.61, marking a 50\% improvement over existing methods, alongside competitive tracking capabilities. GUIDE establishes a new benchmark in autonomous perception systems, effectively combining precision with computational efficiency to better address the complexities of real-world driving environments.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) rendering in real-time on resource-constrained devices is essential for delivering immersive augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) experiences. However, existing solutions struggle to achieve high frame rates, especially for high-resolution rendering. Our analysis identifies the sorting stage in the 3DGS rendering pipeline as the major bottleneck due to its high memory bandwidth demand. This paper presents Neo, which introduces a reuse-and-update sorting algorithm that exploits temporal redundancy in Gaussian ordering across consecutive frames, and devises a hardware accelerator optimized for this algorithm. By efficiently tracking and updating Gaussian depth ordering instead of re-sorting from scratch, Neo significantly reduces redundant computations and memory bandwidth pressure. Experimental results show that Neo achieves up to 10.0x and 5.6x higher throughput than state-of-the-art edge GPU and ASIC solution, respectively, while reducing DRAM traffic by 94.5% and 81.3%. These improvements make high-quality and low-latency on-device 3D rendering more practical.

**Abstract**: High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging is essential for professional digital media creation, e.g., filmmaking, virtual production, and photorealistic rendering. However, 3D scene reconstruction has primarily focused on Low Dynamic Range (LDR) data, limiting its applicability to professional workflows. Existing approaches that reconstruct HDR scenes from LDR observations rely on multi-exposure fusion or inverse tone-mapping, which increase capture complexity and depend on synthetic supervision. With the recent emergence of cameras that directly capture native HDR data in a single exposure, we present the first method for 3D scene reconstruction that directly models native HDR observations. We propose {\bf Native High dynamic range 3D Gaussian Splatting (NH-3DGS)}, which preserves the full dynamic range throughout the reconstruction pipeline. Our key technical contribution is a novel luminance-chromaticity decomposition of the color representation that enables direct optimization from native HDR camera data. We demonstrate on both synthetic and real multi-view HDR datasets that NH-3DGS significantly outperforms existing methods in reconstruction quality and dynamic range preservation, enabling professional-grade 3D reconstruction directly from native HDR captures. Code and datasets will be made available.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading framework for novel view synthesis, yet its core optimization challenges remain underexplored. We identify two key issues in 3DGS optimization: entrapment in suboptimal local optima and insufficient convergence quality. To address these, we propose Opt3DGS, a robust framework that enhances 3DGS through a two-stage optimization process of adaptive exploration and curvature-guided exploitation. In the exploration phase, an Adaptive Weighted Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) method enhances global search to escape local optima. In the exploitation phase, a Local Quasi-Newton Direction-guided Adam optimizer leverages curvature information for precise and efficient convergence. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that Opt3DGS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality by refining the 3DGS optimization process without modifying its underlying representation.

## SplatSearch: Instance Image Goal Navigation for Mobile Robots using 3D Gaussian Splatting and Diffusion Models

**Abstract**: The Instance Image Goal Navigation (IIN) problem requires mobile robots deployed in unknown environments to search for specific objects or people of interest using only a single reference goal image of the target. This problem can be especially challenging when: 1) the reference image is captured from an arbitrary viewpoint, and 2) the robot must operate with sparse-view scene reconstructions. In this paper, we address the IIN problem, by introducing SplatSearch, a novel architecture that leverages sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstructions. SplatSearch renders multiple viewpoints around candidate objects using a sparse online 3DGS map, and uses a multi-view diffusion model to complete missing regions of the rendered images, enabling robust feature matching against the goal image. A novel frontier exploration policy is introduced which uses visual context from the synthesized viewpoints with semantic context from the goal image to evaluate frontier locations, allowing the robot to prioritize frontiers that are semantically and visually relevant to the goal image. Extensive experiments in photorealistic home and real-world environments validate the higher performance of SplatSearch against current state-of-the-art methods in terms of Success Rate and Success Path Length. An ablation study confirms the design choices of SplatSearch.

**Abstract**: We introduce a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates object detection and pose estimation with a versatile onboarding process. Our pipeline begins with an onboarding stage that generates object representations from either traditional 3D CAD models or, in their absence, by rapidly reconstructing a high-fidelity neural representation (NeRF) from multi-view images. Given a test image, our system first employs the CNOS detector to localize target objects. For each detection, our novel pose estimation module, OPFormer, infers the precise 6D pose. The core of OPFormer is a transformer-based architecture that leverages a foundation model for robust feature extraction. It uniquely learns a comprehensive object representation by jointly encoding multiple template views and enriches these features with explicit 3D geometric priors using Normalized Object Coordinate Space (NOCS). A decoder then establishes robust 2D-3D correspondences to determine the final pose. Evaluated on the challenging BOP benchmarks, our integrated system demonstrates a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency, showcasing its practical applicability in both model-based and model-free scenarios.

## SRSplat: Feed-Forward Super-Resolution Gaussian Splatting from Sparse Multi-View Images

**Abstract**: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction from sparse, low-resolution (LR) images is a crucial capability for real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and embodied AI. However, existing methods often fail to recover fine texture details. This limitation stems from the inherent lack of high-frequency information in LR inputs. To address this, we propose \textbf{SRSplat}, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs high-resolution 3D scenes from only a few LR views. Our main insight is to compensate for the deficiency of texture information by jointly leveraging external high-quality reference images and internal texture cues. We first construct a scene-specific reference gallery, generated for each scene using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and diffusion models. To integrate this external information, we introduce the \textit{Reference-Guided Feature Enhancement (RGFE)} module, which aligns and fuses features from the LR input images and their reference twin image. Subsequently, we train a decoder to predict the Gaussian primitives using the multi-view fused feature obtained from \textit{RGFE}. To further refine predicted Gaussian primitives, we introduce \textit{Texture-Aware Density Control (TADC)}, which adaptively adjusts Gaussian density based on the internal texture richness of the LR inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SRSplat outperforms existing methods on various datasets, including RealEstate10K, ACID, and DTU, and exhibits strong cross-dataset and cross-resolution generalization capabilities.

**Abstract**: Online Scene Change Detection (SCD) is an extremely challenging problem that requires an agent to detect relevant changes on the fly while observing the scene from unconstrained viewpoints. Existing online SCD methods are significantly less accurate than offline approaches. We present the first online SCD approach that is pose-agnostic, label-free, and ensures multi-view consistency, while operating at over 10 FPS and achieving new state-of-the-art performance, surpassing even the best offline approaches. Our method introduces a new self-supervised fusion loss to infer scene changes from multiple cues and observations, PnP-based fast pose estimation against the reference scene, and a fast change-guided update strategy for the 3D Gaussian Splatting scene representation. Extensive experiments on complex real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms both online and offline baselines.

**Abstract**: Recent GS-based rendering has made significant progress for LiDAR, surpassing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) in both quality and speed. However, these methods exhibit artifacts in extrapolated novel view synthesis due to the incomplete reconstruction from single traversal scans. To address this limitation, we present LiDAR-GS++, a LiDAR Gaussian Splatting reconstruction method enhanced by diffusion priors for real-time and high-fidelity re-simulation on public urban roads. Specifically, we introduce a controllable LiDAR generation model conditioned on coarsely extrapolated rendering to produce extra geometry-consistent scans and employ an effective distillation mechanism for expansive reconstruction. By extending reconstruction to under-fitted regions, our approach ensures global geometric consistency for extrapolative novel views while preserving detailed scene surfaces captured by sensors. Experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that LiDAR-GS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance for both interpolated and extrapolated viewpoints, surpassing existing GS and NeRF-based methods.

**Abstract**: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

**Abstract**: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

**Abstract**: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy.

## RealisticDreamer: Guidance Score Distillation for Few-shot Gaussian Splatting

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

**Abstract**: Three-dimensional reconstruction in scenes with extreme depth variations remains challenging due to inconsistent supervisory signals between near-field and far-field regions. Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions. This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset. This framework bridges physical imaging principles and learning-based depth regularization, offering a scalable solution for complex depth stratification in urban environments.

**Abstract**: We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting offers a strong speed-quality trade-off but struggles to reconstruct semi-transparent surfaces because most methods assume a single depth per pixel, which fails when multiple surfaces are visible. We propose TSPE-GS (Transparent Surface Probabilistic Extraction for Gaussian Splatting), which uniformly samples transmittance to model a pixel-wise multi-modal distribution of opacity and depth, replacing the prior single-peak assumption and resolving cross-surface depth ambiguity. By progressively fusing truncated signed distance functions, TSPE-GS reconstructs external and internal surfaces separately within a unified framework. The method generalizes to other Gaussian-based reconstruction pipelines without extra training overhead. Extensive experiments on public and self-collected semi-transparent and opaque datasets show TSPE-GS significantly improves semi-transparent geometry reconstruction while maintaining performance on opaque scenes.

**Abstract**: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

**Abstract**: With the rapid advancement of 3D visualization, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading technique for real-time, high-fidelity rendering. While prior research has emphasized algorithmic performance and visual fidelity, the perceptual quality of 3DGS-rendered content, especially under varying reconstruction conditions, remains largely underexplored. In practice, factors such as viewpoint sparsity, limited training iterations, point downsampling, noise, and color distortions can significantly degrade visual quality, yet their perceptual impact has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present 3DGS-QA, the first subjective quality assessment dataset for 3DGS. It comprises 225 degraded reconstructions across 15 object types, enabling a controlled investigation of common distortion factors. Based on this dataset, we introduce a no-reference quality prediction model that directly operates on native 3D Gaussian primitives, without requiring rendered images or ground-truth references. Our model extracts spatial and photometric cues from the Gaussian representation to estimate perceived quality in a structure-aware manner. We further benchmark existing quality assessment methods, spanning both traditional and learning-based approaches. Experimental results show that our method consistently achieves superior performance, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness for 3DGS content evaluation. The dataset and code are made publicly available at https://github.com/diaoyn/3DGSQA to facilitate future research in 3DGS quality assessment.

**Abstract**: Accurate 3D reconstruction from multi-view images is essential for downstream robotic tasks such as navigation, manipulation, and environment understanding. However, obtaining precise camera poses in real-world settings remains challenging, even when calibration parameters are known. This limits the practicality of existing NeRF-based methods that rely heavily on accurate extrinsic estimates. Furthermore, their implicit volumetric representations differ significantly from the widely adopted polygonal meshes, making rendering and manipulation inefficient in standard 3D software. In this work, we propose a robust framework that reconstructs high-quality, editable 3D meshes directly from multi-view images with noisy extrinsic parameters. Our approach jointly refines camera poses while learning an implicit scene representation that captures fine geometric detail and photorealistic appearance. The resulting meshes are compatible with common 3D graphics and robotics tools, enabling efficient downstream use. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves accurate and robust 3D reconstruction under pose uncertainty, bridging the gap between neural implicit representations and practical robotic applications.

We propose \textbf{UltraGS}, a Gaussian Splatting framework optimized for ultrasound imaging. First, we introduce a depth-aware Gaussian splatting strategy, where each Gaussian is assigned a learnable field of view, enabling accurate depth prediction and precise structural representation. Second, we design SH-DARS, a lightweight rendering function combining low-order spherical harmonics with ultrasound-specific wave physics, including depth attenuation, reflection, and scattering, to model tissue intensity accurately. Third, we contribute the Clinical Ultrasound Examination Dataset, a benchmark capturing diverse anatomical scans under real-world clinical protocols. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate UltraGS's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art results in PSNR (up to 29.55), SSIM (up to 0.89), and MSE (as low as 0.002) while enabling real-time synthesis at 64.69 fps.

**Abstract**: Accurate 3D human pose estimation is fundamental for applications such as augmented reality and human-robot interaction. State-of-the-art multi-view methods learn to fuse predictions across views by training on large annotated datasets, leading to poor generalization when the test scenario differs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkelSplat, a novel framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation based on differentiable Gaussian rendering. Human pose is modeled as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians, one per joint, optimized via differentiable rendering to enable seamless fusion of arbitrary camera views without 3D ground-truth supervision. Since Gaussian Splatting was originally designed for dense scene reconstruction, we propose a novel one-hot encoding scheme that enables independent optimization of human joints. SkelSplat outperforms approaches that do not rely on 3D ground truth in Human3.6M and CMU, while reducing the cross-dataset error up to 47.8% compared to learning-based methods. Experiments on Human3.6M-Occ and Occlusion-Person demonstrate robustness to occlusions, without scenario-specific fine-tuning. Our project page is available here: https://skelsplat.github.io.

**Abstract**: Talking Face Generation (TFG) aims to produce realistic and dynamic talking portraits, with broad applications in fields such as digital education, film and television production, e-commerce live streaming, and other related areas. Currently, TFG methods based on Neural Radiated Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian sputtering (3DGS) are received widespread attention. They learn and store personalized features from reference videos of each target individual to generate realistic speaking videos. To ensure models can capture sufficient 3D information and successfully learns the lip-audio mapping, previous studies usually require meticulous processing and fitting several minutes of reference video, which always takes hours. The computational burden of processing and fitting long reference videos severely limits the practical application value of these methods.However, is it really necessary to fit such minutes of reference video? Our exploratory case studies show that using some informative reference video segments of just a few seconds can achieve performance comparable to or even better than the full reference video. This indicates that video informative quality is much more important than its length. Inspired by this observation, we propose the ISExplore (short for Informative Segment Explore), a simple-yet-effective segment selection strategy that automatically identifies the informative 5-second reference video segment based on three key data quality dimensions: audio feature diversity, lip movement amplitude, and number of camera views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach increases data processing and training speed by more than 5x for NeRF and 3DGS methods, while maintaining high-fidelity output.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a key rendering pipeline for
digital asset creation due to its balance between efficiency and visual
quality. To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene
representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large
outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from
two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we
leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale
environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's
triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment.
Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps
maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce
normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce
consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These
constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance
the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected
datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of
the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets. In
terms of scene representation, the results show that our method significantly
outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines. Notably, on self-collected datasets
characterized by weak or repetitive textures, our approach demonstrates
enhanced visualization capabilities and achieves superior overall performance.

**Abstract**: Remarkable advances in recent 2D image and 3D shape generation have induced a
significant focus on dynamic 4D content generation. However, previous 4D
generation methods commonly struggle to maintain spatial-temporal consistency
and adapt poorly to rapid temporal variations, due to the lack of effective
spatial-temporal modeling. To address these problems, we propose a novel 4D
generation network called 4DSTR, which modulates generative 4D Gaussian
Splatting with spatial-temporal rectification. Specifically, temporal
correlation across generated 4D sequences is designed to rectify deformable
scales and rotations and guarantee temporal consistency. Furthermore, an
adaptive spatial densification and pruning strategy is proposed to address
significant temporal variations by dynamically adding or deleting Gaussian
points with the awareness of their pre-frame movements. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our 4DSTR achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-4D
generation, excelling in reconstruction quality, spatial-temporal consistency,
and adaptation to rapid temporal movements.

**Abstract**: Dynamic Gaussian Splatting approaches have achieved remarkable performance
for 4D scene reconstruction. However, these approaches rely on dense-frame
video sequences for photorealistic reconstruction. In real-world scenarios, due
to equipment constraints, sometimes only sparse frames are accessible. In this
paper, we propose Sparse4DGS, the first method for sparse-frame dynamic scene
reconstruction. We observe that dynamic reconstruction methods fail in both
canonical and deformed spaces under sparse-frame settings, especially in areas
with high texture richness. Sparse4DGS tackles this challenge by focusing on
texture-rich areas. For the deformation network, we propose Texture-Aware
Deformation Regularization, which introduces a texture-based depth alignment
loss to regulate Gaussian deformation. For the canonical Gaussian field, we
introduce Texture-Aware Canonical Optimization, which incorporates
texture-based noise into the gradient descent process of canonical Gaussians.
Extensive experiments show that when taking sparse frames as inputs, our method
outperforms existing dynamic or few-shot techniques on NeRF-Synthetic,
HyperNeRF, NeRF-DS, and our iPhone-4D datasets.

**Abstract**: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently emerged as a promising technique for 3D
object reconstruction, delivering high-quality rendering results with
significantly improved reconstruction speed. As variants continue to appear,
assessing the perceptual quality of 3D objects reconstructed with different
GS-based methods remains an open challenge. To address this issue, we first
propose a unified multi-distance subjective quality assessment method that
closely mimics human viewing behavior for objects reconstructed with GS-based
methods in actual applications, thereby better collecting perceptual
experiences. Based on it, we also construct a novel GS quality assessment
dataset named MUGSQA, which is constructed considering multiple uncertainties
of the input data. These uncertainties include the quantity and resolution of
input views, the view distance, and the accuracy of the initial point cloud.
Moreover, we construct two benchmarks: one to evaluate the robustness of
various GS-based reconstruction methods under multiple uncertainties, and the
other to evaluate the performance of existing quality assessment metrics. Our
dataset and benchmark code will be released soon.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enhances 3D scene reconstruction through
explicit representation and fast rendering, demonstrating potential benefits
for various low-level vision tasks, including video compression. However,
existing 3DGS-based video codecs generally exhibit more noticeable visual
artifacts and relatively low compression ratios. In this paper, we specifically
target the perceptual enhancement of 3DGS-based video compression, based on the
assumption that artifacts from 3DGS rendering and quantization resemble noisy
latents sampled during diffusion training. Building on this premise, we propose
a content-adaptive framework, GFix, comprising a streamlined, single-step
diffusion model that serves as an off-the-shelf neural enhancer. Moreover, to
increase compression efficiency, We propose a modulated LoRA scheme that
freezes the low-rank decompositions and modulates the intermediate hidden
states, thereby achieving efficient adaptation of the diffusion backbone with
highly compressible updates. Experimental results show that GFix delivers
strong perceptual quality enhancement, outperforming GSVC with up to 72.1%
BD-rate savings in LPIPS and 21.4% in FID.

**Abstract**: Urban scene reconstruction is critical for autonomous driving, enabling
structured 3D representations for data synthesis and closed-loop testing.
Supervised approaches rely on costly human annotations and lack scalability,
while current self-supervised methods often confuse static and dynamic elements
and fail to distinguish individual dynamic objects, limiting fine-grained
editing. We propose DIAL-GS, a novel dynamic instance-aware reconstruction
method for label-free street scenes with 4D Gaussian Splatting. We first
accurately identify dynamic instances by exploiting appearance-position
inconsistency between warped rendering and actual observation. Guided by
instance-level dynamic perception, we employ instance-aware 4D Gaussians as the
unified volumetric representation, realizing dynamic-adaptive and
instance-aware reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a reciprocal mechanism
through which identity and dynamics reinforce each other, enhancing both
integrity and consistency. Experiments on urban driving scenarios show that
DIAL-GS surpasses existing self-supervised baselines in reconstruction quality
and instance-level editing, offering a concise yet powerful solution for urban
scene modeling.

**Abstract**: Fast and flexible 3D scene reconstruction from unstructured image collections
remains a significant challenge. We present YoNoSplat, a feedforward model that
reconstructs high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting representations from an
arbitrary number of images. Our model is highly versatile, operating
effectively with both posed and unposed, calibrated and uncalibrated inputs.
YoNoSplat predicts local Gaussians and camera poses for each view, which are
aggregated into a global representation using either predicted or provided
poses. To overcome the inherent difficulty of jointly learning 3D Gaussians and
camera parameters, we introduce a novel mixing training strategy. This approach
mitigates the entanglement between the two tasks by initially using
ground-truth poses to aggregate local Gaussians and gradually transitioning to
a mix of predicted and ground-truth poses, which prevents both training
instability and exposure bias. We further resolve the scale ambiguity problem
by a novel pairwise camera-distance normalization scheme and by embedding
camera intrinsics into the network. Moreover, YoNoSplat also predicts intrinsic
parameters, making it feasible for uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat demonstrates
exceptional efficiency, reconstructing a scene from 100 views (at 280x518
resolution) in just 2.69 seconds on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU. It achieves
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks in both pose-free and
pose-dependent settings. Our project page is at

**Abstract**: Rain degrades the visual quality of multi-view images, which are essential
for 3D scene reconstruction, resulting in inaccurate and incomplete
reconstruction results. Existing datasets often overlook two critical
characteristics of real rainy 3D scenes: the viewpoint-dependent variation in
the appearance of rain streaks caused by their projection onto 2D images, and
the reduction in ambient brightness resulting from cloud coverage during
rainfall. To improve data realism, we construct a new dataset named OmniRain3D
that incorporates perspective heterogeneity and brightness dynamicity, enabling
more faithful simulation of rain degradation in 3D scenes. Based on this
dataset, we propose an end-to-end reconstruction framework named REVR-GSNet
(Rain Elimination and Visibility Recovery for 3D Gaussian Splatting).
Specifically, REVR-GSNet integrates recursive brightness enhancement, Gaussian
primitive optimization, and GS-guided rain elimination into a unified
architecture through joint alternating optimization, achieving high-fidelity
reconstruction of clean 3D scenes from rain-degraded inputs. Extensive
experiments show the effectiveness of our dataset and method. Our dataset and
method provide a foundation for future research on multi-view image deraining
and rainy 3D scene reconstruction.

## ConeGS: Error-Guided Densification Using Pixel Cones for Improved  Reconstruction with Fewer Primitives

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves state-of-the-art image quality and
real-time performance in novel view synthesis but often suffers from a
suboptimal spatial distribution of primitives. This issue stems from
cloning-based densification, which propagates Gaussians along existing
geometry, limiting exploration and requiring many primitives to adequately
cover the scene. We present ConeGS, an image-space-informed densification
framework that is independent of existing scene geometry state. ConeGS first
creates a fast Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (iNGP) reconstruction as a
geometric proxy to estimate per-pixel depth. During the subsequent 3DGS
optimization, it identifies high-error pixels and inserts new Gaussians along
the corresponding viewing cones at the predicted depth values, initializing
their size according to the cone diameter. A pre-activation opacity penalty
rapidly removes redundant Gaussians, while a primitive budgeting strategy
controls the total number of primitives, either by a fixed budget or by
adapting to scene complexity, ensuring high reconstruction quality. Experiments
show that ConeGS consistently enhances reconstruction quality and rendering
performance across Gaussian budgets, with especially strong gains under tight
primitive constraints where efficient placement is crucial.

**Abstract**: Despite recent advances in single-object front-facing inpainting using NeRF
and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), inpainting in complex 360{\deg} scenes
remains largely underexplored. This is primarily due to three key challenges:
(i) identifying target objects in the 3D field of 360{\deg} environments, (ii)
dealing with severe occlusions in multi-object scenes, which makes it hard to
define regions to inpaint, and (iii) maintaining consistent and high-quality
appearance across views effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose
Inpaint360GS, a flexible 360{\deg} editing framework based on 3DGS that
supports multi-object removal and high-fidelity inpainting in 3D space. By
distilling 2D segmentation into 3D and leveraging virtual camera views for
contextual guidance, our method enables accurate object-level editing and
consistent scene completion. We further introduce a new dataset tailored for
360{\deg} inpainting, addressing the lack of ground truth object-free scenes.
Experiments demonstrate that Inpaint360GS outperforms existing baselines and
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Project page:

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) implicitly model continuous three-dimensional
scenes using a set of images with known camera poses, enabling the rendering of
photorealistic novel views. However, existing NeRF-based methods encounter
challenges in applications such as autonomous driving and robotic perception,
primarily due to the difficulty of capturing accurate camera poses and
limitations in handling large-scale dynamic environments. To address these
issues, we propose Vision-only Dynamic NeRF (VDNeRF), a method that accurately
recovers camera trajectories and learns spatiotemporal representations for
dynamic urban scenes without requiring additional camera pose information or
expensive sensor data. VDNeRF employs two separate NeRF models to jointly
reconstruct the scene. The static NeRF model optimizes camera poses and static
background, while the dynamic NeRF model incorporates the 3D scene flow to
ensure accurate and consistent reconstruction of dynamic objects. To address
the ambiguity between camera motion and independent object motion, we design an
effective and powerful training framework to achieve robust camera pose
estimation and self-supervised decomposition of static and dynamic elements in
a scene. Extensive evaluations on mainstream urban driving datasets demonstrate
that VDNeRF surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF-based pose-free methods in both
camera pose estimation and dynamic novel view synthesis.

**Abstract**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), an explicit scene representation technique, has shown significant promise for dynamic novel-view synthesis from monocular video input. However, purely data-driven 3DGS often struggles to capture the diverse physics-driven motion patterns in dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, we propose Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting (PIDG), which treats each Gaussian particle as a Lagrangian material point with time-varying constitutive parameters and is supervised by 2D optical flow via motion projection. Specifically, we adopt static-dynamic decoupled 4D decomposed hash encoding to reconstruct geometry and motion efficiently. Subsequently, we impose the Cauchy momentum residual as a physics constraint, enabling independent prediction of each particle's velocity and constitutive stress via a time-evolving material field. Finally, we further supervise data fitting by matching Lagrangian particle flow to camera-compensated optical flow, which accelerates convergence and improves generalization. Experiments on a custom physics-driven dataset as well as on standard synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant gains in physical consistency and monocular dynamic reconstruction quality.

**Abstract**: Streaming free-viewpoint video~(FVV) in real-time still faces significant
challenges, particularly in training, rendering, and transmission efficiency.
Harnessing superior performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting~(3DGS), recent
3DGS-based FVV methods have achieved notable breakthroughs in both training and
rendering. However, the storage requirements of these methods can reach up to
$10$MB per frame, making stream FVV in real-time impossible. To address this
problem, we propose a novel FVV representation, dubbed StreamSTGS, designed for
real-time streaming. StreamSTGS represents a dynamic scene using canonical 3D
Gaussians, temporal features, and a deformation field. For high compression
efficiency, we encode canonical Gaussian attributes as 2D images and temporal
features as a video. This design not only enables real-time streaming, but also
inherently supports adaptive bitrate control based on network condition without
any extra training. Moreover, we propose a sliding window scheme to aggregate
adjacent temporal features to learn local motions, and then introduce a
transformer-guided auxiliary training module to learn global motions. On
diverse FVV benchmarks, StreamSTGS demonstrates competitive performance on all
metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StreamSTGS increases the
PSNR by an average of $1$dB while reducing the average frame size to just
$170$KB. The code is publicly available on https://github.com/kkkzh/StreamSTGS.

## Splatography: Sparse multi-view dynamic Gaussian Splatting for  filmmaking challenges

**Abstract**: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

**Abstract**: Geospatial sensor data is essential for modern defense and security, offering
indispensable 3D information for situational awareness. This data, gathered
from sources like lidar sensors and optical cameras, allows for the creation of
detailed models of operational environments. In this paper, we provide a
comparative analysis of traditional representation methods, such as point
clouds, voxel grids, and triangle meshes, alongside modern neural and implicit
techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). Our evaluation reveals a fundamental trade-off: traditional models
offer robust geometric accuracy ideal for functional tasks like line-of-sight
analysis and physics simulations, while modern methods excel at producing
high-fidelity, photorealistic visuals but often lack geometric reliability.
Based on these findings, we conclude that a hybrid approach is the most
promising path forward. We propose a system architecture that combines a
traditional mesh scaffold for geometric integrity with a neural representation
like 3DGS for visual detail, managed within a hierarchical scene structure to
ensure scalability and performance.

**Abstract**: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large
dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to

**Abstract**: Channel knowledge map (CKM) has emerged as a pivotal technology for
environment-aware wireless communications and sensing, which provides a priori
location-specific channel knowledge to facilitate network optimization.
Efficient CKM construction is an important technical problem for its effective
implementation. This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent
advances in CKM construction. First, we examine classical interpolation-based
CKM construction methods, highlighting their limitations in practical
deployments. Next, we explore image processing and generative artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques, which leverage feature extraction to construct
CKMs based on environmental knowledge. Furthermore, we present emerging
wireless radiance field (WRF) frameworks that exploit neural radiance fields or
Gaussian splatting to construct high-fidelity CKMs from sparse measurement
data. Finally, we outline various future research directions in real-time and
cross-domain CKM construction, as well as cost-efficient deployment of CKMs.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

**Abstract**: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

**Abstract**: Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS) aims to interpret
free-form language expressions and localize the corresponding 3D regions in
Gaussian fields. While recent advances have introduced cross-modal alignment
between language and 3D geometry, existing pipelines still struggle with
cross-view consistency due to their reliance on 2D rendered pseudo supervision
and view specific feature learning. In this work, we present Camera Aware
Referring Field (CaRF), a fully differentiable framework that operates directly
in the 3D Gaussian space and achieves multi view consistency. Specifically,
CaRF introduces Gaussian Field Camera Encoding (GFCE), which incorporates
camera geometry into Gaussian text interactions to explicitly model view
dependent variations and enhance geometric reasoning. Building on this, In
Training Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian
logits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single
view overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.
Extensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF
achieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of
the art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.
Moreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene
understanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and
autonomous perception.

**Abstract**: Robotic manipulation policies are advancing rapidly, but their direct
evaluation in the real world remains costly, time-consuming, and difficult to
reproduce, particularly for tasks involving deformable objects. Simulation
provides a scalable and systematic alternative, yet existing simulators often
fail to capture the coupled visual and physical complexity of soft-body
interactions. We present a real-to-sim policy evaluation framework that
constructs soft-body digital twins from real-world videos and renders robots,
objects, and environments with photorealistic fidelity using 3D Gaussian
Splatting. We validate our approach on representative deformable manipulation
tasks, including plush toy packing, rope routing, and T-block pushing,
demonstrating that simulated rollouts correlate strongly with real-world
execution performance and reveal key behavioral patterns of learned policies.
Our results suggest that combining physics-informed reconstruction with
high-quality rendering enables reproducible, scalable, and accurate evaluation
of robotic manipulation policies. Website: https://real2sim-eval.github.io/

**Abstract**: The dominant 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) acceleration methods fail to
properly regulate the number of Gaussians during training, causing redundant
computational time overhead. In this paper, we propose FastGS, a novel, simple,
and general acceleration framework that fully considers the importance of each
Gaussian based on multi-view consistency, efficiently solving the trade-off
between training time and rendering quality. We innovatively design a
densification and pruning strategy based on multi-view consistency, dispensing
with the budgeting mechanism. Extensive experiments on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks &
Temples, and Deep Blending datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in training speed, achieving a
3.32$\times$ training acceleration and comparable rendering quality compared
with DashGaussian on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset and a 15.45$\times$ acceleration
compared with vanilla 3DGS on the Deep Blending dataset. We demonstrate that
FastGS exhibits strong generality, delivering 2-7$\times$ training acceleration
across various tasks, including dynamic scene reconstruction, surface
reconstruction, sparse-view reconstruction, large-scale reconstruction, and
simultaneous localization and mapping. The project page is available at

## DentalSplat: Dental Occlusion Novel View Synthesis from Sparse  Intra-Oral Photographs

**Abstract**: In orthodontic treatment, particularly within telemedicine contexts,
observing patients' dental occlusion from multiple viewpoints facilitates
timely clinical decision-making. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view
synthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely
captured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting
their practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three
sparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,
rendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity
of input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of
camera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these
limitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D
reconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a
prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,
followed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training
efficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely
sparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric
constraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering
fidelity. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset comprising 950
clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases designed to
simulate real-world remote orthodontic imaging conditions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method effectively handles sparse input scenarios and
achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion
visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

## LiteVoxel: Low-memory Intelligent Thresholding for Efficient Voxel  Rasterization

**Abstract**: Sparse-voxel rasterization is a fast, differentiable alternative for
optimization-based scene reconstruction, but it tends to underfit low-frequency
content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that
inflate VRAM. We introduce LiteVoxel, a self-tuning training pipeline that
makes SV rasterization both steadier and lighter. Our loss is made
low-frequency aware via an inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training
gamma-ramp, shifting gradient budget to flat regions only after geometry
stabilize. Adaptation replaces fixed thresholds with a depth-quantile pruning
logic on maximum blending weight, stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards and
refines structure through ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision
under an explicit growth budget. Ablations and full-system results across
Mip-NeRF 360 (6scenes) and Tanks & Temples (3scenes) datasets show mitigation
of errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping
PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to a strong SVRaster pipeline.
Crucially, LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by ~40%-60% and preserves low-frequency
detail that prior setups miss, enabling more predictable, memory-efficient
training without sacrificing perceptual quality.

**Abstract**: We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and
semantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe
view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in
3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D
heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder
followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through
iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At
the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on
DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric
and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in
novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to
extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this
base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the
encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry
and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control
geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.
We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model
through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt
geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural
language or image prompts.

## Object-Centric 3D Gaussian Splatting for Strawberry Plant Reconstruction  and Phenotyping

**Abstract**: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United
States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for
approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays
a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits
such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional
plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful
frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of
multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable
non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their
promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct
the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,
increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction
framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment
Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean
strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate
geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With
a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate
important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN
clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show
that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry
plant phenotyping.

**Abstract**: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves efficient rendering for novel
view synthesis, extending it to dynamic scenes still results in substantial
memory overhead from replicating Gaussians across frames. To address this
challenge, we propose 4D Neural Voxel Splatting (4D-NVS), which combines
voxel-based representations with neural Gaussian splatting for efficient
dynamic scene modeling. Instead of generating separate Gaussian sets per
timestamp, our method employs a compact set of neural voxels with learned
deformation fields to model temporal dynamics. The design greatly reduces
memory consumption and accelerates training while preserving high image
quality. We further introduce a novel view refinement stage that selectively
improves challenging viewpoints through targeted optimization, maintaining
global efficiency while enhancing rendering quality for difficult viewing
angles. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches with significant memory reduction and faster training, enabling
real-time rendering with superior visual fidelity.
