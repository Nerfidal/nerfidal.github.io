**Abstract**: Learning in deep weight spaces (DWS), where neural networks process the
weights of other neural networks, is an emerging research direction, with
applications to 2D and 3D neural fields (INRs, NeRFs), as well as making
inferences about other types of neural networks. Unfortunately, weight space
models tend to suffer from substantial overfitting. We empirically analyze the
reasons for this overfitting and find that a key reason is the lack of
diversity in DWS datasets. While a given object can be represented by many
different weight configurations, typical INR training sets fail to capture
variability across INRs that represent the same object. To address this, we
explore strategies for data augmentation in weight spaces and propose a MixUp
method adapted for weight spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these
methods in two setups. In classification, they improve performance similarly to
having up to 10 times more data. In self-supervised contrastive learning, they
yield substantial 5-10% gains in downstream classification.

**Abstract**: Creating controllable 3D human portraits from casual smartphone videos is
highly desirable due to their immense value in AR/VR applications. The recent
development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown improvements in rendering
quality and training efficiency. However, it still remains a challenge to
accurately model and disentangle head movements and facial expressions from a
single-view capture to achieve high-quality renderings. In this paper, we
introduce Rig3DGS to address this challenge. We represent the entire scene,
including the dynamic subject, using a set of 3D Gaussians in a canonical
space. Using a set of control signals, such as head pose and expressions, we
transform them to the 3D space with learned deformations to generate the
desired rendering. Our key innovation is a carefully designed deformation
method which is guided by a learnable prior derived from a 3D morphable model.
This approach is highly efficient in training and effective in controlling
facial expressions, head positions, and view synthesis across various captures.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned deformation through extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments. The project page can be found at

**Abstract**: We consider the problem of novel view synthesis (NVS) for dynamic scenes.
Recent neural approaches have accomplished exceptional NVS results for static
3D scenes, but extensions to 4D time-varying scenes remain non-trivial. Prior
efforts often encode dynamics by learning a canonical space plus implicit or
explicit deformation fields, which struggle in challenging scenarios like
sudden movements or capturing high-fidelity renderings. In this paper, we
introduce 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), a novel method that represents dynamic
scenes with anisotropic 4D XYZT Gaussians, inspired by the success of 3D
Gaussian Splatting in static scenes. We model dynamics at each timestamp by
temporally slicing the 4D Gaussians, which naturally compose dynamic 3D
Gaussians and can be seamlessly projected into images. As an explicit
spatial-temporal representation, 4DGS demonstrates powerful capabilities for
modeling complicated dynamics and fine details, especially for scenes with
abrupt motions. We further implement our temporal slicing and splatting
techniques in a highly optimized CUDA acceleration framework, achieving
real-time inference rendering speeds of up to 277 FPS on an RTX 3090 GPU and
583 FPS on an RTX 4090 GPU. Rigorous evaluations on scenes with diverse motions
showcase the superior efficiency and effectiveness of 4DGS, which consistently
outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

**Abstract**: Semantic understanding plays a crucial role in Dense Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM), facilitating comprehensive scene
interpretation. Recent advancements that integrate Gaussian Splatting into SLAM
systems have demonstrated its effectiveness in generating high-quality
renderings through the use of explicit 3D Gaussian representations. Building on
this progress, we propose SGS-SLAM, the first semantic dense visual SLAM system
grounded in 3D Gaussians, which provides precise 3D semantic segmentation
alongside high-fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we propose to employ
multi-channel optimization during the mapping process, integrating appearance,
geometric, and semantic constraints with key-frame optimization to enhance
reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGS-SLAM
delivers state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation, map
reconstruction, and semantic segmentation, outperforming existing methods
meanwhile preserving real-time rendering ability.

**Abstract**: Deep learning is providing a wealth of new approaches to the old problem of
novel view synthesis, from Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) based approaches to
end-to-end style architectures. Each approach offers specific strengths but
also comes with specific limitations in their applicability. This work
introduces ViewFusion, a state-of-the-art end-to-end generative approach to
novel view synthesis with unparalleled flexibility. ViewFusion consists in
simultaneously applying a diffusion denoising step to any number of input views
of a scene, then combining the noise gradients obtained for each view with an
(inferred) pixel-weighting mask, ensuring that for each region of the target
scene only the most informative input views are taken into account. Our
approach resolves several limitations of previous approaches by (1) being
trainable and generalizing across multiple scenes and object classes, (2)
adaptively taking in a variable number of pose-free views at both train and
test time, (3) generating plausible views even in severely undetermined
conditions (thanks to its generative nature) -- all while generating views of
quality on par or even better than state-of-the-art methods. Limitations
include not generating a 3D embedding of the scene, resulting in a relatively
slow inference speed, and our method only being tested on the relatively small
dataset NMR. Code is available.

**Abstract**: In recent years, a range of neural network-based methods for image rendering
have been introduced. For instance, widely-researched neural radiance fields
(NeRF) rely on a neural network to represent 3D scenes, allowing for realistic
view synthesis from a small number of 2D images. However, most NeRF models are
constrained by long training and inference times. In comparison, Gaussian
Splatting (GS) is a novel, state-of-theart technique for rendering points in a
3D scene by approximating their contribution to image pixels through Gaussian
distributions, warranting fast training and swift, real-time rendering. A
drawback of GS is the absence of a well-defined approach for its conditioning
due to the necessity to condition several hundred thousand Gaussian components.
To solve this, we introduce Gaussian Mesh Splatting (GaMeS) model, a hybrid of
mesh and a Gaussian distribution, that pin all Gaussians splats on the object
surface (mesh). The unique contribution of our methods is defining Gaussian
splats solely based on their location on the mesh, allowing for automatic
adjustments in position, scale, and rotation during animation. As a result, we
obtain high-quality renders in the real-time generation of high-quality views.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the absence of a predefined mesh, it is
possible to fine-tune the initial mesh during the learning process.

## Robust Inverse Graphics via Probabilistic Inference

**Abstract**: How do we infer a 3D scene from a single image in the presence of corruptions
like rain, snow or fog? Straightforward domain randomization relies on knowing
the family of corruptions ahead of time. Here, we propose a Bayesian
approach-dubbed robust inverse graphics (RIG)-that relies on a strong scene
prior and an uninformative uniform corruption prior, making it applicable to a
wide range of corruptions. Given a single image, RIG performs posterior
inference jointly over the scene and the corruption. We demonstrate this idea
by training a neural radiance field (NeRF) scene prior and using a secondary
NeRF to represent the corruptions over which we place an uninformative prior.
RIG, trained only on clean data, outperforms depth estimators and alternative
NeRF approaches that perform point estimation instead of full inference. The
results hold for a number of scene prior architectures based on normalizing
flows and diffusion models. For the latter, we develop reconstruction-guidance
with auxiliary latents (ReGAL)-a diffusion conditioning algorithm that is
applicable in the presence of auxiliary latent variables such as the
corruption. RIG demonstrates how scene priors can be used beyond generation
tasks.

## HyperPlanes: Hypernetwork Approach to Rapid NeRF Adaptation

**Abstract**: Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are a widely accepted standard for
synthesizing new 3D object views from a small number of base images. However,
NeRFs have limited generalization properties, which means that we need to use
significant computational resources to train individual architectures for each
item we want to represent. To address this issue, we propose a few-shot
learning approach based on the hypernetwork paradigm that does not require
gradient optimization during inference. The hypernetwork gathers information
from the training data and generates an update for universal weights. As a
result, we have developed an efficient method for generating a high-quality 3D
object representation from a small number of images in a single step. This has
been confirmed by direct comparison with the state-of-the-art solutions and a
comprehensive ablation study.

**Abstract**: Volumetric videos, benefiting from immersive 3D realism and interactivity,
hold vast potential for various applications, while the tremendous data volume
poses significant challenges for compression. Recently, NeRF has demonstrated
remarkable potential in volumetric video compression thanks to its simple
representation and powerful 3D modeling capabilities, where a notable work is
ReRF. However, ReRF separates the modeling from compression process, resulting
in suboptimal compression efficiency. In contrast, in this paper, we propose a
volumetric video compression method based on dynamic NeRF in a more compact
manner. Specifically, we decompose the NeRF representation into the coefficient
fields and the basis fields, incrementally updating the basis fields in the
temporal domain to achieve dynamic modeling. Additionally, we perform
end-to-end joint optimization on the modeling and compression process to
further improve the compression efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves higher compression efficiency compared to ReRF on
various datasets.

| 2024-02-02 | Yaokun Li, Chao Gou, Guang Tan | cs.CV | [PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01217v2){: .btn .btn-green } |

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated effectiveness in synthesizing
novel views. However, their reliance on dense inputs and scene-specific
optimization has limited their broader applicability. Generalizable NeRFs
(Gen-NeRF), while intended to address this, often produce blurring artifacts in
unobserved regions with sparse inputs, which are full of uncertainty. In this
paper, we aim to diminish the uncertainty in Gen-NeRF for plausible renderings.
We assume that NeRF's inability to effectively mitigate this uncertainty stems
from its inherent lack of generative capacity. Therefore, we innovatively
propose an Indirect Diffusion-guided NeRF framework, termed ID-NeRF, to address
this uncertainty from a generative perspective by leveraging a distilled
diffusion prior as guidance. Specifically, to avoid model confusion caused by
directly regularizing with inconsistent samplings as in previous methods, our
approach introduces a strategy to indirectly inject the inherently missing
imagination into the learned implicit function through a diffusion-guided
latent space. Empirical evaluation across various benchmarks demonstrates the
superior performance of our approach in handling uncertainty with sparse
inputs.

**Abstract**: Collaborative mapping of unknown environments can be done faster and more
robustly than a single robot. However, a collaborative approach requires a
distributed paradigm to be scalable and deal with communication issues. This
work presents a fully distributed algorithm enabling a group of robots to
collectively optimize the parameters of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). The
algorithm involves the communication of each robot's trained NeRF parameters
over a mesh network, where each robot trains its NeRF and has access to its own
visual data only. Additionally, the relative poses of all robots are jointly
optimized alongside the model parameters, enabling mapping with unknown
relative camera poses. We show that multi-robot systems can benefit from
differentiable and robust 3D reconstruction optimized from multiple NeRFs.
Experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the efficiency of the
proposed algorithm. See the website of the project for videos of the
experiments and supplementary

**Abstract**: Most of the existing works on arbitrary 3D NeRF style transfer required
retraining on each single style condition. This work aims to achieve zero-shot
controlled stylization in 3D scenes utilizing text or visual input as
conditioning factors. We introduce ConRF, a novel method of zero-shot
stylization. Specifically, due to the ambiguity of CLIP features, we employ a
conversion process that maps the CLIP feature space to the style space of a
pre-trained VGG network and then refine the CLIP multi-modal knowledge into a
style transfer neural radiation field. Additionally, we use a 3D volumetric
representation to perform local style transfer. By combining these operations,
ConRF offers the capability to utilize either text or images as references,
resulting in the generation of sequences with novel views enhanced by global or
local stylization. Our experiment demonstrates that ConRF outperforms other
existing methods for 3D scene and single-text stylization in terms of visual
quality.

**Abstract**: Artistic video portrait generation is a significant and sought-after task in
the fields of computer graphics and vision. While various methods have been
developed that integrate NeRFs or StyleGANs with instructional editing models
for creating and editing drivable portraits, these approaches face several
challenges. They often rely heavily on large datasets, require extensive
customization processes, and frequently result in reduced image quality. To
address the above problems, we propose the Efficient Monotonic Video Style
Avatar (Emo-Avatar) through deferred neural rendering that enhances StyleGAN's
capacity for producing dynamic, drivable portrait videos. We proposed a
two-stage deferred neural rendering pipeline. In the first stage, we utilize
few-shot PTI initialization to initialize the StyleGAN generator through
several extreme poses sampled from the video to capture the consistent
representation of aligned faces from the target portrait. In the second stage,
we propose a Laplacian pyramid for high-frequency texture sampling from UV maps
deformed by dynamic flow of expression for motion-aware texture prior
integration to provide torso features to enhance StyleGAN's ability to generate
complete and upper body for portrait video rendering. Emo-Avatar reduces style
customization time from hours to merely 5 minutes compared with existing
methods. In addition, Emo-Avatar requires only a single reference image for
editing and employs region-aware contrastive learning with semantic invariant
CLIP guidance, ensuring consistent high-resolution output and identity
preservation. Through both quantitative and qualitative assessments, Emo-Avatar
demonstrates superior performance over existing methods in terms of training
efficiency, rendering quality and editability in self- and cross-reenactment.

## 360-GS: Layout-guided Panoramic Gaussian Splatting For Indoor Roaming

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted great attention with
real-time and photo-realistic renderings. This technique typically takes
perspective images as input and optimizes a set of 3D elliptical Gaussians by
splatting them onto the image planes, resulting in 2D Gaussians. However,
applying 3D-GS to panoramic inputs presents challenges in effectively modeling
the projection onto the spherical surface of ${360^\circ}$ images using 2D
Gaussians. In practical applications, input panoramas are often sparse, leading
to unreliable initialization of 3D Gaussians and subsequent degradation of
3D-GS quality. In addition, due to the under-constrained geometry of
texture-less planes (e.g., walls and floors), 3D-GS struggles to model these
flat regions with elliptical Gaussians, resulting in significant floaters in
novel views. To address these issues, we propose 360-GS, a novel $360^{\circ}$
Gaussian splatting for a limited set of panoramic inputs. Instead of splatting
3D Gaussians directly onto the spherical surface, 360-GS projects them onto the
tangent plane of the unit sphere and then maps them to the spherical
projections. This adaptation enables the representation of the projection using
Gaussians. We guide the optimization of 360-GS by exploiting layout priors
within panoramas, which are simple to obtain and contain strong structural
information about the indoor scene. Our experimental results demonstrate that
360-GS allows panoramic rendering and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
fewer artifacts in novel view synthesis, thus providing immersive roaming in
indoor scenarios.

## Optimal Projection for 3D Gaussian Splatting

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting has garnered extensive attention and application in
real-time neural rendering. Concurrently, concerns have been raised about the
limitations of this technology in aspects such as point cloud storage,
performance , and robustness in sparse viewpoints , leading to various
improvements. However, there has been a notable lack of attention to the
projection errors introduced by the local affine approximation inherent in the
splatting itself, and the consequential impact of these errors on the quality
of photo-realistic rendering. This paper addresses the projection error
function of 3D Gaussian Splatting, commencing with the residual error from the
first-order Taylor expansion of the projection function $\phi$. The analysis
establishes a correlation between the error and the Gaussian mean position.
Subsequently, leveraging function optimization theory, this paper analyzes the
function's minima to provide an optimal projection strategy for Gaussian
Splatting referred to Optimal Gaussian Splatting. Experimental validation
further confirms that this projection methodology reduces artifacts, resulting
in a more convincingly realistic rendering.

## StopThePop: Sorted Gaussian Splatting for View-Consistent Real-time  Rendering

**Abstract**: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a prominent model for constructing 3D
representations from images across diverse domains. However, the efficiency of
the 3D Gaussian Splatting rendering pipeline relies on several simplifications.
Notably, reducing Gaussian to 2D splats with a single view-space depth
introduces popping and blending artifacts during view rotation. Addressing this
issue requires accurate per-pixel depth computation, yet a full per-pixel sort
proves excessively costly compared to a global sort operation. In this paper,
we present a novel hierarchical rasterization approach that systematically
resorts and culls splats with minimal processing overhead. Our software
rasterizer effectively eliminates popping artifacts and view inconsistencies,
as demonstrated through both quantitative and qualitative measurements.
Simultaneously, our method mitigates the potential for cheating view-dependent
effects with popping, ensuring a more authentic representation. Despite the
elimination of cheating, our approach achieves comparable quantitative results
for test images, while increasing the consistency for novel view synthesis in
motion. Due to its design, our hierarchical approach is only 4% slower on
average than the original Gaussian Splatting. Notably, enforcing consistency
enables a reduction in the number of Gaussians by approximately half with
nearly identical quality and view-consistency. Consequently, rendering
performance is nearly doubled, making our approach 1.6x faster than the
original Gaussian Splatting, with a 50% reduction in memory requirements.

## ViCA-NeRF: View-Consistency-Aware 3D Editing of Neural Radiance Fields

**Abstract**: We introduce ViCA-NeRF, the first view-consistency-aware method for 3D
editing with text instructions. In addition to the implicit neural radiance
field (NeRF) modeling, our key insight is to exploit two sources of
regularization that explicitly propagate the editing information across
different views, thus ensuring multi-view consistency. For geometric
regularization, we leverage the depth information derived from NeRF to
establish image correspondences between different views. For learned
regularization, we align the latent codes in the 2D diffusion model between
edited and unedited images, enabling us to edit key views and propagate the
update throughout the entire scene. Incorporating these two strategies, our
ViCA-NeRF operates in two stages. In the initial stage, we blend edits from
different views to create a preliminary 3D edit. This is followed by a second
stage of NeRF training, dedicated to further refining the scene's appearance.
Experimental results demonstrate that ViCA-NeRF provides more flexible,
efficient (3 times faster) editing with higher levels of consistency and
details, compared with the state of the art. Our code is publicly available.
