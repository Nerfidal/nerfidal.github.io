**Abstract**: Most novel view synthesis methods such as NeRF are unable to capture the true
high dynamic range (HDR) radiance of scenes since they are typically trained on
photos captured with standard low dynamic range (LDR) cameras. While the
traditional exposure bracketing approach which captures several images at
different exposures has recently been adapted to the multi-view case, we find
such methods to fall short of capturing the full dynamic range of indoor
scenes, which includes very bright light sources. In this paper, we present
PanDORA: a PANoramic Dual-Observer Radiance Acquisition system for the casual
capture of indoor scenes in high dynamic range. Our proposed system comprises
two 360{\deg} cameras rigidly attached to a portable tripod. The cameras
simultaneously acquire two 360{\deg} videos: one at a regular exposure and the
other at a very fast exposure, allowing a user to simply wave the apparatus
casually around the scene in a matter of minutes. The resulting images are fed
to a NeRF-based algorithm that reconstructs the scene's full high dynamic
range. Compared to HDR baselines from previous work, our approach reconstructs
the full HDR radiance of indoor scenes without sacrificing the visual quality
while retaining the ease of capture from recent NeRF-like approaches.

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are an advanced technology that creates highly
realistic images by learning about scenes through a neural network model.
However, NeRF often encounters issues when there are not enough images to work
with, leading to problems in accurately rendering views. The main issue is that
NeRF lacks sufficient structural details to guide the rendering process
accurately. To address this, we proposed a Depth and Normal Dense Completion
Priors for NeRF (CP\_NeRF) framework. This framework enhances view rendering by
adding depth and normal dense completion priors to the NeRF optimization
process. Before optimizing NeRF, we obtain sparse depth maps using the
Structure from Motion (SfM) technique used to get camera poses. Based on the
sparse depth maps and a normal estimator, we generate sparse normal maps for
training a normal completion prior with precise standard deviations. During
optimization, we apply depth and normal completion priors to transform sparse
data into dense depth and normal maps with their standard deviations. We use
these dense maps to guide ray sampling, assist distance sampling and construct
a normal loss function for better training accuracy. To improve the rendering
of NeRF's normal outputs, we incorporate an optical centre position embedder
that helps synthesize more accurate normals through volume rendering.
Additionally, we employ a normal patch matching technique to choose accurate
rendered normal maps, ensuring more precise supervision for the model. Our
method is superior to leading techniques in rendering detailed indoor scenes,
even with limited input views.

**Abstract**: Although recent efforts have extended Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) into
LiDAR point cloud synthesis, the majority of existing works exhibit a strong
dependence on precomputed poses. However, point cloud registration methods
struggle to achieve precise global pose estimation, whereas previous pose-free
NeRFs overlook geometric consistency in global reconstruction. In light of
this, we explore the geometric insights of point clouds, which provide explicit
registration priors for reconstruction. Based on this, we propose Geometry
guided Neural LiDAR Fields(GeoNLF), a hybrid framework performing alternately
global neural reconstruction and pure geometric pose optimization. Furthermore,
NeRFs tend to overfit individual frames and easily get stuck in local minima
under sparse-view inputs. To tackle this issue, we develop a
selective-reweighting strategy and introduce geometric constraints for robust
optimization. Extensive experiments on NuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of GeoNLF in both novel view synthesis and
multi-view registration of low-frequency large-scale point clouds.

**Abstract**: Dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) from monocular videos has recently been
explored for space-time novel view synthesis and achieved excellent results.
However, defocus blur caused by depth variation often occurs in video capture,
compromising the quality of dynamic reconstruction because the lack of sharp
details interferes with modeling temporal consistency between input views. To
tackle this issue, we propose D2RF, the first dynamic NeRF method designed to
restore sharp novel views from defocused monocular videos. We introduce layered
Depth-of-Field (DoF) volume rendering to model the defocus blur and reconstruct
a sharp NeRF supervised by defocused views. The blur model is inspired by the
connection between DoF rendering and volume rendering. The opacity in volume
rendering aligns with the layer visibility in DoF rendering.To execute the
blurring, we modify the layered blur kernel to the ray-based kernel and employ
an optimized sparse kernel to gather the input rays efficiently and render the
optimized rays with our layered DoF volume rendering. We synthesize a dataset
with defocused dynamic scenes for our task, and extensive experiments on our
dataset show that our method outperforms existing approaches in synthesizing
all-in-focus novel views from defocus blur while maintaining spatial-temporal
consistency in the scene.

**Abstract**: Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem for large-scale 3D scene
scanning and reconstruction. With the help of deep learning, registration
methods have evolved significantly, reaching a nearly-mature stage. As the
introduction of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), it has become the most popular
3D scene representation as its powerful view synthesis capabilities. Regarding
NeRF representation, its registration is also required for large-scale scene
reconstruction. However, this topic extremly lacks exploration. This is due to
the inherent challenge to model the geometric relationship among two scenes
with implicit representations. The existing methods usually convert the
implicit representation to explicit representation for further registration.
Most recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) is introduced, employing explicit 3D
Gaussian. This method significantly enhances rendering speed while maintaining
high rendering quality. Given two scenes with explicit GS representations, in
this work, we explore the 3D registration task between them. To this end, we
propose GaussReg, a novel coarse-to-fine framework, both fast and accurate. The
coarse stage follows existing point cloud registration methods and estimates a
rough alignment for point clouds from GS. We further newly present an
image-guided fine registration approach, which renders images from GS to
provide more detailed geometric information for precise alignment. To support
comprehensive evaluation, we carefully build a scene-level dataset called
ScanNet-GSReg with 1379 scenes obtained from the ScanNet dataset and collect an
in-the-wild dataset called GSReg. Experimental results demonstrate our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. Our GaussReg is 44
times faster than HLoc (SuperPoint as the feature extractor and SuperGlue as
the matcher) with comparable accuracy.

## PICA: Physics-Integrated Clothed Avatar

**Abstract**: We introduce PICA, a novel representation for high-fidelity animatable
clothed human avatars with physics-accurate dynamics, even for loose clothing.
Previous neural rendering-based representations of animatable clothed humans
typically employ a single model to represent both the clothing and the
underlying body. While efficient, these approaches often fail to accurately
represent complex garment dynamics, leading to incorrect deformations and
noticeable rendering artifacts, especially for sliding or loose garments.
Furthermore, previous works represent garment dynamics as pose-dependent
deformations and facilitate novel pose animations in a data-driven manner. This
often results in outcomes that do not faithfully represent the mechanics of
motion and are prone to generating artifacts in out-of-distribution poses. To
address these issues, we adopt two individual 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
models with different deformation characteristics, modeling the human body and
clothing separately. This distinction allows for better handling of their
respective motion characteristics. With this representation, we integrate a
graph neural network (GNN)-based clothed body physics simulation module to
ensure an accurate representation of clothing dynamics. Our method, through its
carefully designed features, achieves high-fidelity rendering of clothed human
bodies in complex and novel driving poses, significantly outperforming previous
methods under the same settings.

**Abstract**: Dynamic reconstruction of deformable tissues in endoscopic video is a key
technology for robot-assisted surgery. Recent reconstruction methods based on
neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have achieved remarkable results in the
reconstruction of surgical scenes. However, based on implicit representation,
NeRFs struggle to capture the intricate details of objects in the scene and
cannot achieve real-time rendering. In addition, restricted single view
perception and occluded instruments also propose special challenges in surgical
scene reconstruction. To address these issues, we develop SurgicalGaussian, a
deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting method to model dynamic surgical scenes. Our
approach models the spatio-temporal features of soft tissues at each time stamp
via a forward-mapping deformation MLP and regularization to constrain local 3D
Gaussians to comply with consistent movement. With the depth initialization
strategy and tool mask-guided training, our method can remove surgical
instruments and reconstruct high-fidelity surgical scenes. Through experiments
on various surgical videos, our network outperforms existing method on many
aspects, including rendering quality, rendering speed and GPU usage. The

**Abstract**: Modeling, understanding, and reconstructing the real world are crucial in
XR/VR. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) methods have shown remarkable
success in modeling and understanding 3D scenes. Similarly, various 4D
representations have demonstrated the ability to capture the dynamics of the 4D
world. However, there is a dearth of research focusing on segmentation within
4D representations. In this paper, we propose Segment Any 4D Gaussians (SA4D),
one of the first frameworks to segment anything in the 4D digital world based
on 4D Gaussians. In SA4D, an efficient temporal identity feature field is
introduced to handle Gaussian drifting, with the potential to learn precise
identity features from noisy and sparse input. Additionally, a 4D segmentation
refinement process is proposed to remove artifacts. Our SA4D achieves precise,
high-quality segmentation within seconds in 4D Gaussians and shows the ability
to remove, recolor, compose, and render high-quality anything masks. More demos

**Abstract**: We present GSD, a diffusion model approach based on Gaussian Splatting (GS)
representation for 3D object reconstruction from a single view. Prior works
suffer from inconsistent 3D geometry or mediocre rendering quality due to
improper representations. We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings
by utilizing the recent state-of-the-art 3D explicit representation, Gaussian
Splatting, and an unconditional diffusion model. This model learns to generate
3D objects represented by sets of GS ellipsoids. With these strong generative
3D priors, though learning unconditionally, the diffusion model is ready for
view-guided reconstruction without further model fine-tuning. This is achieved
by propagating fine-grained 2D features through the efficient yet flexible
splatting function and the guided denoising sampling process. In addition, a 2D
diffusion model is further employed to enhance rendering fidelity, and improve
reconstructed GS quality by polishing and re-using the rendered images. The
final reconstructed objects explicitly come with high-quality 3D structure and
texture, and can be efficiently rendered in arbitrary views. Experiments on the
challenging real-world CO3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
approach.

**Abstract**: We present personalized Gaussian Eigen Models (GEMs) for human heads, a novel
method that compresses dynamic 3D Gaussians into low-dimensional linear spaces.
Our approach is inspired by the seminal work of Blanz and Vetter, where a
mesh-based 3D morphable model (3DMM) is constructed from registered meshes.
Based on dynamic 3D Gaussians, we create a lower-dimensional representation of
primitives that applies to most 3DGS head avatars. Specifically, we propose a
universal method to distill the appearance of a mesh-controlled UNet Gaussian
avatar using an ensemble of linear eigenbasis. We replace heavy CNN-based
architectures with a single linear layer improving speed and enabling a range
of real-time downstream applications. To create a particular facial expression,
one simply needs to perform a dot product between the eigen coefficients and
the distilled basis. This efficient method removes the requirement for an input
mesh during testing, enhancing simplicity and speed in expression generation.
This process is highly efficient and supports real-time rendering on everyday
devices, leveraging the effectiveness of standard Gaussian Splatting. In
addition, we demonstrate how the GEM can be controlled using a ResNet-based
regression architecture. We show and compare self-reenactment and cross-person
reenactment to state-of-the-art 3D avatar methods, demonstrating higher quality
and better control. A real-time demo showcases the applicability of the GEM
representation.

**Abstract**: Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have received significant attention due to
their high-quality novel view rendering ability, prompting research to address
various real-world cases. One critical challenge is the camera motion blur
caused by camera movement during exposure time, which prevents accurate 3D
scene reconstruction. In this study, we propose continuous rigid motion-aware
gaussian splatting (CRiM-GS) to reconstruct accurate 3D scene from blurry
images with real-time rendering speed. Considering the actual camera motion
blurring process, which consists of complex motion patterns, we predict the
continuous movement of the camera based on neural ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). Specifically, we leverage rigid body transformations to model
the camera motion with proper regularization, preserving the shape and size of
the object. Furthermore, we introduce a continuous deformable 3D transformation
in the \textit{SE(3)} field to adapt the rigid body transformation to
real-world problems by ensuring a higher degree of freedom. By revisiting
fundamental camera theory and employing advanced neural network training
techniques, we achieve accurate modeling of continuous camera trajectories. We
conduct extensive experiments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance both
quantitatively and qualitatively on benchmark datasets.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) demonstrates unparalleled superior performance
in 3D scene reconstruction. However, 3DGS heavily relies on the sharp images.
Fulfilling this requirement can be challenging in real-world scenarios
especially when the camera moves fast, which severely limits the application of
3DGS. To address these challenges, we proposed Spike Gausian Splatting
(SpikeGS), the first framework that integrates the spike streams into 3DGS
pipeline to reconstruct 3D scenes via a fast-moving bio-inspired camera. With
accumulation rasterization, interval supervision, and a specially designed
pipeline, SpikeGS extracts detailed geometry and texture from high temporal
resolution but texture lacking spike stream, reconstructs 3D scenes captured in
1 second. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of SpikeGS compared with existing spike-based and
deblur 3D scene reconstruction methods. Codes and data will be released soon.

**Abstract**: Rendering high-fidelity images from sparse point clouds is still challenging.
Existing learning-based approaches suffer from either hole artifacts, missing
details, or expensive computations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
to render high-quality images from sparse points. This method first attempts to
bridge the 3D Gaussian Splatting and point cloud rendering, which includes
several cascaded modules. We first use a regressor to estimate Gaussian
properties in a point-wise manner, the estimated properties are used to
rasterize neural feature descriptors into 2D planes which are extracted from a
multiscale extractor. The projected feature volume is gradually decoded toward
the final prediction via a multiscale and progressive decoder. The whole
pipeline experiences a two-stage training and is driven by our well-designed
progressive and multiscale reconstruction loss. Experiments on different
benchmarks show the superiority of our method in terms of rendering qualities
and the necessities of our main components.

**Abstract**: Neural rendering-based urban scene reconstruction methods commonly rely on
images collected from driving vehicles with cameras facing and moving forward.
Although these methods can successfully synthesize from views similar to
training camera trajectory, directing the novel view outside the training
camera distribution does not guarantee on-par performance. In this paper, we
tackle the Extrapolated View Synthesis (EVS) problem by evaluating the
reconstructions on views such as looking left, right or downwards with respect
to training camera distributions. To improve rendering quality for EVS, we
initialize our model by constructing dense LiDAR map, and propose to leverage
prior scene knowledge such as surface normal estimator and large-scale
diffusion model. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods on EVS. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to address the EVS problem in urban scene reconstruction. Link to our

**Abstract**: Real-time 3D reconstruction of surgical scenes plays a vital role in
computer-assisted surgery, holding a promise to enhance surgeons' visibility.
Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown great potential
for real-time novel view synthesis of general scenes, which relies on accurate
poses and point clouds generated by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) for
initialization. However, 3DGS with SfM fails to recover accurate camera poses
and geometry in surgical scenes due to the challenges of minimal textures and
photometric inconsistencies. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose
the first SfM-free 3DGS-based method for surgical scene reconstruction by
jointly optimizing the camera poses and scene representation. Based on the
video continuity, the key of our method is to exploit the immediate optical
flow priors to guide the projection flow derived from 3D Gaussians. Unlike most
previous methods relying on photometric loss only, we formulate the pose
estimation problem as minimizing the flow loss between the projection flow and
optical flow. A consistency check is further introduced to filter the flow
outliers by detecting the rigid and reliable points that satisfy the epipolar
geometry. During 3D Gaussian optimization, we randomly sample frames to
optimize the scene representations to grow the 3D Gaussian progressively.
Experiments on the SCARED dataset demonstrate our superior performance over
existing methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation with high
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/wrld/Free-SurGS.

**Abstract**: Despite significant strides in the field of 3D scene editing, current methods
encounter substantial challenge, particularly in preserving 3D consistency in
multi-view editing process. To tackle this challenge, we propose a progressive
3D editing strategy that ensures multi-view consistency via a
Trajectory-Anchored Scheme (TAS) with a dual-branch editing mechanism.
Specifically, TAS facilitates a tightly coupled iterative process between 2D
view editing and 3D updating, preventing error accumulation yielded from
text-to-image process. Additionally, we explore the relationship between
optimization-based methods and reconstruction-based methods, offering a unified
perspective for selecting superior design choice, supporting the rationale
behind the designed TAS. We further present a tuning-free View-Consistent
Attention Control (VCAC) module that leverages cross-view semantic and
geometric reference from the source branch to yield aligned views from the
target branch during the editing of 2D views. To validate the effectiveness of
our method, we analyze 2D examples to demonstrate the improved consistency with
the VCAC module. Further extensive quantitative and qualitative results in
text-guided 3D scene editing indicate that our method achieves superior editing
quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make the complete
codebase publicly available following the conclusion of the double-blind review
process.

**Abstract**: Neural implicit representation of visual scenes has attracted a lot of
attention in recent research of computer vision and graphics. Most prior
methods focus on how to reconstruct 3D scene representation from a set of
images. In this work, we demonstrate the possibility to recover the neural
radiance fields (NeRF) from a single blurry image and its corresponding event
stream. We model the camera motion with a cubic B-Spline in SE(3) space. Both
the blurry image and the brightness change within a time interval, can then be
synthesized from the 3D scene representation given the 6-DoF poses interpolated
from the cubic B-Spline. Our method can jointly learn both the implicit neural
scene representation and recover the camera motion by minimizing the
differences between the synthesized data and the real measurements without
pre-computed camera poses from COLMAP. We evaluate the proposed method with
both synthetic and real datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that we
are able to render view-consistent latent sharp images from the learned NeRF
and bring a blurry image alive in high quality. Code and data are available at

**Abstract**: Realistic scene reconstruction and view synthesis are essential for advancing
autonomous driving systems by simulating safety-critical scenarios. 3D Gaussian
Splatting excels in real-time rendering and static scene reconstructions but
struggles with modeling driving scenarios due to complex backgrounds, dynamic
objects, and sparse views. We propose AutoSplat, a framework employing Gaussian
splatting to achieve highly realistic reconstructions of autonomous driving
scenes. By imposing geometric constraints on Gaussians representing the road
and sky regions, our method enables multi-view consistent simulation of
challenging scenarios including lane changes. Leveraging 3D templates, we
introduce a reflected Gaussian consistency constraint to supervise both the
visible and unseen side of foreground objects. Moreover, to model the dynamic
appearance of foreground objects, we estimate residual spherical harmonics for
each foreground Gaussian. Extensive experiments on Pandaset and KITTI
demonstrate that AutoSplat outperforms state-of-the-art methods in scene
reconstruction and novel view synthesis across diverse driving scenarios. Visit

**Abstract**: We propose MomentsNeRF, a novel framework for one- and few-shot neural
rendering that predicts a neural representation of a 3D scene using Orthogonal
Moments. Our architecture offers a new transfer learning method to train on
multi-scenes and incorporate a per-scene optimization using one or a few images
at test time. Our approach is the first to successfully harness features
extracted from Gabor and Zernike moments, seamlessly integrating them into the
NeRF architecture. We show that MomentsNeRF performs better in synthesizing
images with complex textures and shapes, achieving a significant noise
reduction, artifact elimination, and completing the missing parts compared to
the recent one- and few-shot neural rendering frameworks. Extensive experiments

**Abstract**: Understanding 3D scenes is a crucial challenge in computer vision research
with applications spanning multiple domains. Recent advancements in distilling
2D vision-language foundation models into neural fields, like NeRF and 3DGS,
enables open-vocabulary segmentation of 3D scenes from 2D multi-view images
without the need for precise 3D annotations. While effective, however, the
per-pixel distillation of high-dimensional CLIP features introduces ambiguity
and necessitates complex regularization strategies, adding inefficiencies
during training. This paper presents MaskField, which enables fast and
efficient 3D open-vocabulary segmentation with neural fields under weak
supervision. Unlike previous methods, MaskField distills masks rather than
dense high-dimensional CLIP features. MaskFields employ neural fields as binary
mask generators and supervise them with masks generated by SAM and classified
by coarse CLIP features. MaskField overcomes the ambiguous object boundaries by
naturally introducing SAM segmented object shapes without extra regularization
during training. By circumventing the direct handling of high-dimensional CLIP
features during training, MaskField is particularly compatible with explicit
scene representations like 3DGS. Our extensive experiments show that MaskField
not only surpasses prior state-of-the-art methods but also achieves remarkably
fast convergence, outperforming previous methods with just 5 minutes of
training. We hope that MaskField will inspire further exploration into how
neural fields can be trained to comprehend 3D scenes from 2D models.

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in large generative models and real-time neural rendering
using point-based techniques pave the way for a future of widespread visual
data distribution through sharing synthesized 3D assets. However, while
standardized methods for embedding proprietary or copyright information, either
overtly or subtly, exist for conventional visual content such as images and
videos, this issue remains unexplored for emerging generative 3D formats like
Gaussian Splatting. We present GaussianStego, a method for embedding
steganographic information in the rendering of generated 3D assets. Our
approach employs an optimization framework that enables the accurate extraction
of hidden information from images rendered using Gaussian assets derived from
large models, while maintaining their original visual quality. We conduct
preliminary evaluations of our method across several potential deployment
scenarios and discuss issues identified through analysis. GaussianStego
represents an initial exploration into the novel challenge of embedding
customizable, imperceptible, and recoverable information within the renders
produced by current 3D generative models, while ensuring minimal impact on the
rendered content's quality.

**Abstract**: One of the core activities of an active observer involves moving to secure a
"better" view of the scene, where the definition of "better" is task-dependent.
This paper focuses on the task of human pose estimation from videos capturing a
person's activity. Self-occlusions within the scene can complicate or even
prevent accurate human pose estimation. To address this, relocating the camera
to a new vantage point is necessary to clarify the view, thereby improving 2D
human pose estimation. This paper formalizes the process of achieving an
improved viewpoint. Our proposed solution to this challenge comprises three
main components: a NeRF-based Drone-View Data Generation Framework, an On-Drone
Network for Camera View Error Estimation, and a Combined Planner for devising a
feasible motion plan to reposition the camera based on the predicted errors for
camera views. The Data Generation Framework utilizes NeRF-based methods to
generate a comprehensive dataset of human poses and activities, enhancing the
drone's adaptability in various scenarios. The Camera View Error Estimation
Network is designed to evaluate the current human pose and identify the most
promising next viewing angles for the drone, ensuring a reliable and precise
pose estimation from those angles. Finally, the combined planner incorporates
these angles while considering the drone's physical and environmental
limitations, employing efficient algorithms to navigate safe and effective
flight paths. This system represents a significant advancement in active 2D
human pose estimation for an autonomous UAV agent, offering substantial
potential for applications in aerial cinematography by improving the
performance of autonomous human pose estimation and maintaining the operational
safety and efficiency of UAVs.

**Abstract**: 3D building reconstruction from imaging data is an important task for many
applications ranging from urban planning to reconnaissance. Modern Novel View
synthesis (NVS) methods like NeRF and Gaussian Splatting offer powerful
techniques for developing 3D models from natural 2D imagery in an unsupervised
fashion. These algorithms generally require input training views surrounding
the scene of interest, which, in the case of large buildings, is typically not
available across all camera elevations. In particular, the most readily
available camera viewpoints at scale across most buildings are at near-ground
(e.g., with mobile phones) and aerial (drones) elevations. However, due to the
significant difference in viewpoint between drone and ground image sets, camera
registration - a necessary step for NVS algorithms - fails. In this work we
propose a method, DRAGON, that can take drone and ground building imagery as
input and produce a 3D NVS model. The key insight of DRAGON is that
intermediate elevation imagery may be extrapolated by an NVS algorithm itself
in an iterative procedure with perceptual regularization, thereby bridging the
visual feature gap between the two elevations and enabling registration. We
compiled a semi-synthetic dataset of 9 large building scenes using Google Earth
Studio, and quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that DRAGON can
generate compelling renderings on this dataset compared to baseline strategies.

**Abstract**: 3D reconstruction of biological tissues from a collection of endoscopic
images is a key to unlock various important downstream surgical applications
with 3D capabilities. Existing methods employ various advanced neural rendering
techniques for photorealistic view synthesis, but they often struggle to
recover accurate 3D representations when only sparse observations are
available, which is usually the case in real-world clinical scenarios. To
tackle this {sparsity} challenge, we propose a framework leveraging the prior
knowledge from multiple foundation models during the reconstruction process,
dubbed as \textit{EndoSparse}. Experimental results indicate that our proposed
strategy significantly improves the geometric and appearance quality under
challenging sparse-view conditions, including using only three views. In
rigorous benchmarking experiments against state-of-the-art methods,
\textit{EndoSparse} achieves superior results in terms of accurate geometry,
realistic appearance, and rendering efficiency, confirming the robustness to
sparse-view limitations in endoscopic reconstruction. \textit{EndoSparse}
signifies a steady step towards the practical deployment of neural 3D
reconstruction in real-world clinical scenarios. Project page:
