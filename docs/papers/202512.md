**Abstract**: LiDAR-captured point clouds are often considered the gold standard in active 3D reconstruction. While their accuracy is exceptional in flat regions, the capturing is susceptible to miss small geometric structures and may fail with dark, absorbent materials. Alternatively, capturing multiple photos of the scene and applying 3D photogrammetry can infer these details as they often represent feature-rich regions. However, the accuracy of LiDAR for featureless regions is rarely reached. Therefore, we suggest combining the strengths of LiDAR and camera-based capture by introducing SurfFill: a Gaussian surfel-based LiDAR completion scheme. We analyze LiDAR capturings and attribute LiDAR beam divergence as a main factor for artifacts, manifesting mostly at thin structures and edges. We use this insight to introduce an ambiguity heuristic for completed scans by evaluating the change in density in the point cloud. This allows us to identify points close to missed areas, which we can then use to grow additional points from to complete the scan. For this point growing, we constrain Gaussian surfel reconstruction [Huang et al. 2024] to focus optimization and densification on these ambiguous areas. Finally, Gaussian primitives of the reconstruction in ambiguous areas are extracted and sampled for points to complete the point cloud. To address the challenges of large-scale reconstruction, we extend this pipeline with a divide-and-conquer scheme for building-sized point cloud completion. We evaluate on the task of LiDAR point cloud completion of synthetic and real-world scenes and find that our method outperforms previous reconstruction methods.

**Abstract**: We propose G-SHARP, a commercially compatible, real-time surgical scene reconstruction framework designed for minimally invasive procedures that require fast and accurate 3D modeling of deformable tissue. While recent Gaussian splatting approaches have advanced real-time endoscopic reconstruction, existing implementations often depend on non-commercial derivatives, limiting deployability. G-SHARP overcomes these constraints by being the first surgical pipeline built natively on the GSplat (Apache-2.0) differentiable Gaussian rasterizer, enabling principled deformation modeling, robust occlusion handling, and high-fidelity reconstructions on the EndoNeRF pulling benchmark. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with strong speed-accuracy trade-offs suitable for intra-operative use. Finally, we provide a Holoscan SDK application that deploys G-SHARP on NVIDIA IGX Orin and Thor edge hardware, enabling real-time surgical visualization in practical operating-room settings.

**Abstract**: Novel view synthesis (NVS) is crucial in computer vision and graphics, with wide applications in AR, VR, and autonomous driving. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with high appearance fidelity, it suffers from multi-view inconsistencies, limiting geometric accuracy. In contrast, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) enforces multi-view consistency but compromises texture details. To address these limitations, we propose Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting (EGGS), a hybrid representation that integrates 2D and 3D Gaussians to balance appearance and geometry. To achieve this, we introduce Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization for unified rendering, Adaptive Type Exchange for dynamic adaptation between 2D and 3D Gaussians, and Frequency-Decoupled Optimization that effectively exploits the strengths of each type of Gaussian representation. Our CUDA-accelerated implementation ensures efficient training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, providing a practical solution for high-quality NVS.

**Abstract**: We present VIGS-SLAM, a visual-inertial 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system that achieves robust real-time tracking and high-fidelity reconstruction. Although recent 3DGS-based SLAM methods achieve dense and photorealistic mapping, their purely visual design degrades under motion blur, low texture, and exposure variations. Our method tightly couples visual and inertial cues within a unified optimization framework, jointly refining camera poses, depths, and IMU states. It features robust IMU initialization, time-varying bias modeling, and loop closure with consistent Gaussian updates. Experiments on four challenging datasets demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Project page: https://vigs-slam.github.io

**Abstract**: Polarization-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) enable novel view synthesis of specular-reflection scenes but face challenges in slow training, inefficient rendering, and strong dependencies on material/viewpoint assumptions. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. To our knowledge, this is the first framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, yielding superior interpretability and real-time performance for modeling complex reflective scenes.

**Abstract**: Gaussian Splatting has become the method of choice for 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering of captured real scenes. However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.
  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

**Abstract**: We introduce PoreTrack3D, the first benchmark for dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting in pore-scale, non-rigid 3D facial trajectory tracking. It contains over 440,000 facial trajectories in total, among which more than 52,000 are longer than 10 frames, including 68 manually reviewed trajectories that span the entire 150 frames. To the best of our knowledge, PoreTrack3D is the first benchmark dataset to capture both traditional facial landmarks and pore-scale keypoints trajectory, advancing the study of fine-grained facial expressions through the analysis of subtle skin-surface motion. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting methods on PoreTrack3D, establishing the first performance baseline in this domain. Overall, the pipeline developed for this benchmark dataset's creation establishes a new framework for high-fidelity facial motion capture and dynamic 3D reconstruction.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality novel view synthesis, motivating interest in generating higher-resolution renders than those available during training. A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

**Abstract**: Topology-consistent dynamic model sequences are essential for applications such as animation and model editing. However, existing 4D reconstruction methods face challenges in generating high-quality topology-consistent meshes. To address this, we propose a topology-aware dynamic reconstruction framework based on Gaussian Splatting. We introduce a Gaussian topological structure that explicitly encodes spatial connectivity. This structure enables topology-aware densification and pruning, preserving the manifold consistency of the Gaussian representation. Temporal regularization terms further ensure topological coherence over time, while differentiable mesh rasterization improves mesh quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reconstructs topology-consistent mesh sequences with significantly higher accuracy than existing approaches. Moreover, the resulting meshes enable precise 3D keypoint tracking. Project page: https://haza628.github.io/tagSplat/

**Abstract**: Real-time 3D reconstruction is a fundamental task in computer graphics. Recently, differentiable-rendering-based SLAM system has demonstrated significant potential, enabling photorealistic scene rendering through learnable scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Current differentiable rendering methods face dual challenges in real-time computation and sensor noise sensitivity, leading to degraded geometric fidelity in scene reconstruction and limited practicality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel real-time system EGG-Fusion, featuring robust sparse-to-dense camera tracking and a geometry-aware Gaussian surfel mapping module, introducing an information filter-based fusion method that explicitly accounts for sensor noise to achieve high-precision surface reconstruction. The proposed differentiable Gaussian surfel mapping effectively models multi-view consistent surfaces while enabling efficient parameter optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a surface reconstruction error of 0.6\textit{cm} on standardized benchmark datasets including Replica and ScanNet++, representing over 20\% improvement in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GS-based methods. Notably, the system maintains real-time processing capabilities at 24 FPS, establishing it as one of the most accurate differentiable-rendering-based real-time reconstruction systems.

**Abstract**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged, demonstrating strong generalization in robotic scene understanding and manipulation. However, when confronted with long-horizon tasks that require defined goal states, such as LEGO assembly or object rearrangement, existing VLA models still face challenges in coordinating high-level planning with precise manipulation. Therefore, we aim to endow a VLA model with the capability to infer the "how" process from the "what" outcomes, transforming goal states into executable procedures. In this paper, we introduce ManualVLA, a unified VLA framework built upon a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, enabling coherent collaboration between multimodal manual generation and action execution. Unlike prior VLA models that directly map sensory inputs to actions, we first equip ManualVLA with a planning expert that generates intermediate manuals consisting of images, position prompts, and textual instructions. Building upon these multimodal manuals, we design a Manual Chain-of-Thought (ManualCoT) reasoning process that feeds them into the action expert, where each manual step provides explicit control conditions, while its latent representation offers implicit guidance for accurate manipulation. To alleviate the burden of data collection, we develop a high-fidelity digital-twin toolkit based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which automatically generates manual data for planning expert training. ManualVLA demonstrates strong real-world performance, achieving an average success rate 32% higher than the previous hierarchical SOTA baseline on LEGO assembly and object rearrangement tasks.
