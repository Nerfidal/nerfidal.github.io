**Abstract**: Recent advancements in Text-to-3D modeling have shown significant potential
for the creation of 3D content. However, due to the complex geometric shapes of
objects in the natural world, generating 3D content remains a challenging task.
Current methods either leverage 2D diffusion priors to recover 3D geometry, or
train the model directly based on specific 3D representations. In this paper,
we propose a novel method named DirectGaussian, which focuses on generating the
surfaces of 3D objects represented by surfels. In DirectGaussian, we utilize
conditional text generation models and the surface of a 3D object is rendered
by 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors. For
multi-view geometric consistency problems, DirectGaussian incorporates
curvature constraints on the generated surface during optimization process.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of
achieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation.

**Abstract**: Capturing and rendering three-dimensional (3D) objects in real time remain a
significant challenge, yet hold substantial potential for applications in
augmented reality, digital twin systems, remote collaboration and prototyping.
We present an end-to-end pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS)
to enable rapid acquisition and interactive rendering of real-world objects
using a mobile device, cloud processing and a local computer. Users scan an
object with a smartphone video, upload it for automated 3D reconstruction, and
visualize it interactively in Unity at an average of 150 frames per second
(fps) on a laptop. The system integrates mobile capture, cloud-based 3D GS and
Unity rendering to support real-time telepresence. Our experiments show that
the pipeline processes scans in approximately 10 minutes on a graphics
processing unit (GPU) achieving real-time rendering on the laptop.

**Abstract**: Persistent dynamic scene modeling for tracking and novel-view synthesis
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing accurate deformations
while maintaining computational efficiency. We propose SCas4D, a cascaded
optimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian
Splatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations
often exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar
transformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level
to fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time
frame and produces results comparable to existing methods with only
one-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates
effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view
synthesis, and dense point tracking tasks.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) systems can largely benefit from 3DGS's state-of-the-art rendering
efficiency and accuracy, but have not yet been adopted in resource-constrained
edge devices due to insufficient speed. Addressing this, we identify notable
redundancies across the SLAM pipeline for acceleration. While conceptually
straightforward, practical approaches are required to minimize the overhead
associated with identifying and eliminating these redundancies. In response, we
propose RTGS, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that comprehensively
reduces the redundancies for real-time 3DGS-SLAM on edge. To minimize the
overhead, RTGS fully leverages the characteristics of the 3DGS-SLAM pipeline.
On the algorithm side, we introduce (1) an adaptive Gaussian pruning step to
remove the redundant Gaussians by reusing gradients computed during
backpropagation; and (2) a dynamic downsampling technique that directly reuses
the keyframe identification and alpha computing steps to eliminate redundant
pixels. On the hardware side, we propose (1) a subtile-level streaming strategy
and a pixel-level pairwise scheduling strategy that mitigates workload
imbalance via a Workload Scheduling Unit (WSU) guided by previous iteration
information; (2) a Rendering and Backpropagation (R&B) Buffer that accelerates
the rendering backpropagation by reusing intermediate data computed during
rendering; and (3) a Gradient Merging Unit (GMU) to reduce intensive memory
accesses caused by atomic operations while enabling pipelined aggregation.
Integrated into an edge GPU, RTGS achieves real-time performance (>= 30 FPS) on
four datasets and three algorithms, with up to 82.5x energy efficiency over the
baseline and negligible quality loss. Code is available at

## ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head  Avatars

| Published | Authors | Category | |

| 2025-10-07 | Peizhi Yan, Rabab Ward, Qiang Tang, Shan Du | cs.CV | [PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05488v1){: .btn .btn-green } |

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

## Active Next-Best-View Optimization for Risk-Averse Path Planning

**Abstract**: Safe navigation in uncertain environments requires planning methods that
integrate risk aversion with active perception. In this work, we present a
unified framework that refines a coarse reference path by constructing
tail-sensitive risk maps from Average Value-at-Risk statistics on an
online-updated 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Field. These maps enable the
generation of locally safe and feasible trajectories. In parallel, we formulate
Next-Best-View (NBV) selection as an optimization problem on the SE(3) pose
manifold, where Riemannian gradient descent maximizes an expected information
gain objective to reduce uncertainty most critical for imminent motion. Our
approach advances the state-of-the-art by coupling risk-averse path refinement
with NBV planning, while introducing scalable gradient decompositions that
support efficient online updates in complex environments. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework through extensive computational
studies.

**Abstract**: 4D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a new paradigm for dynamic scene
representation, enabling real-time rendering of scenes with complex motions.
However, it faces a major challenge of storage overhead, as millions of
Gaussians are required for high-fidelity reconstruction. While several studies
have attempted to alleviate this memory burden, they still face limitations in
compression ratio or visual quality. In this work, we present OMG4 (Optimized
Minimal 4D Gaussian Splatting), a framework that constructs a compact set of
salient Gaussians capable of faithfully representing 4D Gaussian models. Our
method progressively prunes Gaussians in three stages: (1) Gaussian Sampling to
identify primitives critical to reconstruction fidelity, (2) Gaussian Pruning
to remove redundancies, and (3) Gaussian Merging to fuse primitives with
similar characteristics. In addition, we integrate implicit appearance
compression and generalize Sub-Vector Quantization (SVQ) to 4D representations,
further reducing storage while preserving quality. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMG4 significantly outperforms
recent state-of-the-art methods, reducing model sizes by over 60% while
maintaining reconstruction quality. These results position OMG4 as a
significant step forward in compact 4D scene representation, opening new
possibilities for a wide range of applications. Our source code is available at

## From Tokens to Nodes: Semantic-Guided Motion Control for Dynamic 3D  Gaussian Splatting

| 2025-10-03 | Jianing Chen, Zehao Li, Yujun Cai, Hao Jiang, Shuqin Gao, Honglong Zhao, Tianlu Mao, Yucheng Zhang | cs.CV | [PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02732v1){: .btn .btn-green } |

**Abstract**: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract**: Constructing and sharing 3D maps is essential for many applications,
including autonomous driving and augmented reality. Recently, 3D Gaussian
splatting has emerged as a promising approach for accurate 3D reconstruction.
However, a practical map-sharing system that features high-fidelity, continuous
updates, and network efficiency remains elusive. To address these challenges,
we introduce GS-Share, a photorealistic map-sharing system with a compact
representation. The core of GS-Share includes anchor-based global map
construction, virtual-image-based map enhancement, and incremental map update.
We evaluate GS-Share against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that our
system achieves higher fidelity, particularly for extrapolated views, with
improvements of 11%, 22%, and 74% in PSNR, LPIPS, and Depth L1, respectively.
Furthermore, GS-Share is significantly more compact, reducing map transmission
overhead by 36%.

## SketchPlan: Diffusion Based Drone Planning From Human Sketches

**Abstract**: We propose SketchPlan, a diffusion-based planner that interprets 2D
hand-drawn sketches over depth images to generate 3D flight paths for drone
navigation. SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to
map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model
that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth
image. Our model achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate
and safe flight paths in previously unseen real-world environments. To train
the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set
of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data
by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and
use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D
sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label
872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the
SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate
SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and
show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled
data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to
correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. In real-world drone tests,
SketchPlan achieved 100\% success in low/medium clutter and 40\% in unseen
high-clutter environments, outperforming key ablations by 20-60\% in task
completion.

## Geometry Meets Vision: Revisiting Pretrained Semantics in Distilled  Fields

**Abstract**: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

**Abstract**: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

## FSFSplatter: Build Surface and Novel Views with Sparse-Views within 3min

**Abstract**: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

## 4DGS-Craft: Consistent and Interactive 4D Gaussian Splatting Editing

**Abstract**: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

**Abstract**: Simulating greenhouse environments is critical for developing and evaluating
robotic systems for agriculture, yet existing approaches rely on simplistic or
synthetic assets that limit simulation-to-real transfer. Recent advances in
radiance field methods, such as Gaussian splatting, enable photorealistic
reconstruction but have so far been restricted to individual plants or
controlled laboratory conditions. In this work, we introduce GreenhouseSplat, a
framework and dataset for generating photorealistic greenhouse assets directly
from inexpensive RGB images. The resulting assets are integrated into a
ROS-based simulation with support for camera and LiDAR rendering, enabling
tasks such as localization with fiducial markers. We provide a dataset of 82
cucumber plants across multiple row configurations and demonstrate its utility
for robotics evaluation. GreenhouseSplat represents the first step toward
greenhouse-scale radiance-field simulation and offers a foundation for future
research in agricultural robotics.

## LOBE-GS: Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting for  Large-Scale Scene Reconstruction

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

**Abstract**: Visual policy design is crucial for aerial navigation. However,
state-of-the-art visual policies often overfit to a single track and their
performance degrades when track geometry changes. We develop FalconGym 2.0, a
photorealistic simulation framework built on Gaussian Splatting (GSplat) with
an Edit API that programmatically generates diverse static and dynamic tracks
in milliseconds. Leveraging FalconGym 2.0's editability, we propose a
Performance-Guided Refinement (PGR) algorithm, which concentrates visual
policy's training on challenging tracks while iteratively improving its
performance. Across two case studies (fixed-wing UAVs and quadrotors) with
distinct dynamics and environments, we show that a single visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
generalization and robustness: it generalizes to three unseen tracks with 100%
success without per-track retraining and maintains higher success rates under
gate-pose perturbations. Finally, we demonstrate that the visual policy trained
with PGR in FalconGym 2.0 can be zero-shot sim-to-real transferred to a
quadrotor hardware, achieving a 98.6% success rate (69 / 70 gates) over 30
trials spanning two three-gate tracks and a moving-gate track.

**Abstract**: 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As
these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes
critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and
propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically
injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly
visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view
consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based
evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling
objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate
our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

**Abstract**: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape
and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely
on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured
data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.
The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors
3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent
transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware
constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic
correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains
structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This
integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence
throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our
proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior
2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by
26.2%. Project page: https://baiyunshu.github.io/GAUSSIANMORPHING.github.io/

**Abstract**: While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation
from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with
loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works
address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from
limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we
present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view
videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as
photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics
modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which
we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact
with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and
a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme
with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with
quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic
animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)
dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and
efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar
generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not
achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation
generalizability. Our project page is at:

**Abstract**: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a
longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination
are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches
often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse
and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits
relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a
microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian
Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically
consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface
normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate
ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates
convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive
experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially
more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to
existing Gaussian splatting methods.

**Abstract**: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high
detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods
allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions
Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an
object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera
selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity
object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method
prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining
real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves
local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by
$\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a
single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.

**Abstract**: Driving scene manipulation with sensor data is emerging as a promising
alternative to traditional virtual driving simulators. However, existing
frameworks struggle to generate realistic scenarios efficiently due to limited
editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we present SIMSplat, a
predictive driving scene editor with language-aligned Gaussian splatting. As a
language-controlled editor, SIMSplat enables intuitive manipulation using
natural language prompts. By aligning language with Gaussian-reconstructed
scenes, it further supports direct querying of road objects, allowing precise
and flexible editing. Our method provides detailed object-level editing,
including adding new objects and modifying the trajectories of both vehicles
and pedestrians, while also incorporating predictive path refinement through
multi-agent motion prediction to generate realistic interactions among all
agents in the scene. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate SIMSplat's
extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across a wide range of
scenarios. Project page: https://sungyeonparkk.github.io/simsplat/

**Abstract**: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

**Abstract**: Dynamic view synthesis has seen significant advances, yet reconstructing
scenes from uncalibrated, casual video remains challenging due to slow
optimization and complex parameter estimation. In this work, we present
Instant4D, a monocular reconstruction system that leverages native 4D
representation to efficiently process casual video sequences within minutes,
without calibrated cameras or depth sensors. Our method begins with geometric
recovery through deep visual SLAM, followed by grid pruning to optimize scene
representation. Our design significantly reduces redundancy while maintaining
geometric integrity, cutting model size to under 10% of its original footprint.
To handle temporal dynamics efficiently, we introduce a streamlined 4D Gaussian
representation, achieving a 30x speed-up and reducing training time to within
two minutes, while maintaining competitive performance across several
benchmarks. Our method reconstruct a single video within 10 minutes on the
Dycheck dataset or for a typical 200-frame video. We further apply our model to
in-the-wild videos, showcasing its generalizability. Our project website is
published at https://instant4d.github.io/.
