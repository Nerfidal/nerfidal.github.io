**Abstract**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a promising framework for
novel view synthesis, offering fast rendering speeds and high fidelity.
However, the large number of Gaussians and their associated attributes require
effective compression techniques. Existing methods primarily compress neural
Gaussians individually and independently, i.e., coding all the neural Gaussians
at the same time, with little design for their interactions and spatial
dependence. Inspired by the effectiveness of the context model in image
compression, we propose the first autoregressive model at the anchor level for
3DGS compression in this work. We divide anchors into different levels and the
anchors that are not coded yet can be predicted based on the already coded ones
in all the coarser levels, leading to more accurate modeling and higher coding
efficiency. To further improve the efficiency of entropy coding, e.g., to code
the coarsest level with no already coded anchors, we propose to introduce a
low-dimensional quantized feature as the hyperprior for each anchor, which can
be effectively compressed. Our work pioneers the context model in the anchor
level for 3DGS representation, yielding an impressive size reduction of over
100 times compared to vanilla 3DGS and 15 times compared to the most recent
state-of-the-art work Scaffold-GS, while achieving comparable or even higher
rendering quality.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown promising results in image rendering
and surface reconstruction. However, its potential in volumetric reconstruction
tasks, such as X-ray computed tomography, remains under-explored. This paper
introduces R2-Gaussian, the first 3DGS-based framework for sparse-view
tomographic reconstruction. By carefully deriving X-ray rasterization
functions, we discover a previously unknown integration bias in the standard
3DGS formulation, which hampers accurate volume retrieval. To address this
issue, we propose a novel rectification technique via refactoring the
projection from 3D to 2D Gaussians. Our new method presents three key
innovations: (1) introducing tailored Gaussian kernels, (2) extending
rasterization to X-ray imaging, and (3) developing a CUDA-based differentiable
voxelizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches by 0.93 dB in PSNR and 0.014 in SSIM. Crucially, it
delivers high-quality results in 3 minutes, which is 12x faster than NeRF-based
methods and on par with traditional algorithms. The superior performance and
rapid convergence of our method highlight its practical value.

**Abstract**: Current 4D generation methods have achieved noteworthy efficacy with the aid
of advanced diffusion generative models. However, these methods lack multi-view
spatial-temporal modeling and encounter challenges in integrating diverse prior
knowledge from multiple diffusion models, resulting in inconsistent temporal
appearance and flickers. In this paper, we propose a novel 4D generation
pipeline, namely 4Diffusion aimed at generating spatial-temporally consistent
4D content from a monocular video. We first design a unified diffusion model
tailored for multi-view video generation by incorporating a learnable motion
module into a frozen 3D-aware diffusion model to capture multi-view
spatial-temporal correlations. After training on a curated dataset, our
diffusion model acquires reasonable temporal consistency and inherently
preserves the generalizability and spatial consistency of the 3D-aware
diffusion model. Subsequently, we propose 4D-aware Score Distillation Sampling
loss, which is based on our multi-view video diffusion model, to optimize 4D
representation parameterized by dynamic NeRF. This aims to eliminate
discrepancies arising from multiple diffusion models, allowing for generating
spatial-temporally consistent 4D content. Moreover, we devise an anchor loss to
enhance the appearance details and facilitate the learning of dynamic NeRF.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance compared to previous methods.

**Abstract**: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) are a groundbreaking computer vision technology
that enables the generation of high-quality, immersive visual content from
multiple viewpoints. This capability holds significant advantages for
applications such as virtual/augmented reality, 3D modelling and content
creation for the film and entertainment industry. However, the evaluation of
NeRF methods poses several challenges, including a lack of comprehensive
datasets, reliable assessment methodologies, and objective quality metrics.
This paper addresses the problem of NeRF quality assessment thoroughly, by
conducting a rigorous subjective quality assessment test that considers several
scene classes and recently proposed NeRF view synthesis methods. Additionally,
the performance of a wide range of state-of-the-art conventional and
learning-based full-reference 2D image and video quality assessment metrics is
evaluated against the subjective scores of the subjective study. The
experimental results are analyzed in depth, providing a comparative evaluation
of several NeRF methods and objective quality metrics, across different classes
of visual scenes, including real and synthetic content for front-face and
360-degree camera trajectories.

**Abstract**: We present TetSphere splatting, an explicit, Lagrangian representation for
reconstructing 3D shapes with high-quality geometry. In contrast to
conventional object reconstruction methods which predominantly use Eulerian
representations, including both neural implicit (e.g., NeRF, NeuS) and explicit
representations (e.g., DMTet), and often struggle with high computational
demands and suboptimal mesh quality, TetSphere splatting utilizes an underused
but highly effective geometric primitive -- tetrahedral meshes. This approach
directly yields superior mesh quality without relying on neural networks or
post-processing. It deforms multiple initial tetrahedral spheres to accurately
reconstruct the 3D shape through a combination of differentiable rendering and
geometric energy optimization, resulting in significant computational
efficiency. Serving as a robust and versatile geometry representation,
Tet-Sphere splatting seamlessly integrates into diverse applications, including
single-view 3D reconstruction, image-/text-to-3D content generation.
Experimental results demonstrate that TetSphere splatting outperforms existing
representations, delivering faster optimization speed, enhanced mesh quality,
and reliable preservation of thin structures.

**Abstract**: Generalizable perception is one of the pillars of high-level autonomy in
space robotics. Estimating the structure and motion of unknown objects in
dynamic environments is fundamental for such autonomous systems. Traditionally,
the solutions have relied on prior knowledge of target objects, multiple
disparate representations, or low-fidelity outputs unsuitable for robotic
operations. This work proposes a novel approach to incrementally reconstruct
and track a dynamic unknown object using a unified representation -- a set of
3D Gaussian blobs that describe its geometry and appearance. The differentiable
3D Gaussian Splatting framework is adapted to a dynamic object-centric setting.
The input to the pipeline is a sequential set of RGB-D images. 3D
reconstruction and 6-DoF pose tracking tasks are tackled using first-order
gradient-based optimization. The formulation is simple, requires no
pre-training, assumes no prior knowledge of the object or its motion, and is
suitable for online applications. The proposed approach is validated on a
dataset of 10 unknown spacecraft of diverse geometry and texture under
arbitrary relative motion. The experiments demonstrate successful 3D
reconstruction and accurate 6-DoF tracking of the target object in proximity
operations over a short to medium duration. The causes of tracking drift are
discussed and potential solutions are outlined.

**Abstract**: Large-scale vision foundation models such as Segment Anything (SAM)
demonstrate impressive performance in zero-shot image segmentation at multiple
levels of granularity. However, these zero-shot predictions are rarely
3D-consistent. As the camera viewpoint changes in a scene, so do the
segmentation predictions, as well as the characterizations of ``coarse" or
``fine" granularity. In this work, we address the challenging task of lifting
multi-granular and view-inconsistent image segmentations into a hierarchical
and 3D-consistent representation. We learn a novel feature field within a
Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) representing a 3D scene, whose segmentation
structure can be revealed at different scales by simply using different
thresholds on feature distance. Our key idea is to learn an ultrametric feature
space, which unlike a Euclidean space, exhibits transitivity in distance-based
grouping, naturally leading to a hierarchical clustering. Put together, our
method takes view-inconsistent multi-granularity 2D segmentations as input and
produces a hierarchy of 3D-consistent segmentations as output. We evaluate our
method and several baselines on synthetic datasets with multi-view images and
multi-granular segmentation, showcasing improved accuracy and
viewpoint-consistency. We additionally provide qualitative examples of our
model's 3D hierarchical segmentations in real world scenes.\footnote{The code

## GaussianRoom: Improving 3D Gaussian Splatting with SDF Guidance and  Monocular Cues for Indoor Scene Reconstruction

**Abstract**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting(3DGS) has revolutionized neural rendering
with its high-quality rendering and real-time speed. However, when it comes to
indoor scenes with a significant number of textureless areas, 3DGS yields
incomplete and noisy reconstruction results due to the poor initialization of
the point cloud and under-constrained optimization. Inspired by the continuity
of signed distance field (SDF), which naturally has advantages in modeling
surfaces, we present a unified optimizing framework integrating neural SDF with
3DGS. This framework incorporates a learnable neural SDF field to guide the
densification and pruning of Gaussians, enabling Gaussians to accurately model
scenes even with poor initialized point clouds. At the same time, the geometry
represented by Gaussians improves the efficiency of the SDF field by piloting
its point sampling. Additionally, we regularize the optimization with normal
and edge priors to eliminate geometry ambiguity in textureless areas and
improve the details. Extensive experiments in ScanNet and ScanNet++ show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both surface reconstruction
and novel view synthesis.

**Abstract**: Advances in NERFs have allowed for 3D scene reconstructions and novel view
synthesis. Yet, efficiently editing these representations while retaining
photorealism is an emerging challenge. Recent methods face three primary
limitations: they're slow for interactive use, lack precision at object
boundaries, and struggle to ensure multi-view consistency. We introduce IReNe
to address these limitations, enabling swift, near real-time color editing in
NeRF. Leveraging a pre-trained NeRF model and a single training image with
user-applied color edits, IReNe swiftly adjusts network parameters in seconds.
This adjustment allows the model to generate new scene views, accurately
representing the color changes from the training image while also controlling
object boundaries and view-specific effects. Object boundary control is
achieved by integrating a trainable segmentation module into the model. The
process gains efficiency by retraining only the weights of the last network
layer. We observed that neurons in this layer can be classified into those
responsible for view-dependent appearance and those contributing to diffuse
appearance. We introduce an automated classification approach to identify these
neuron types and exclusively fine-tune the weights of the diffuse neurons. This
further accelerates training and ensures consistent color edits across
different views. A thorough validation on a new dataset, with edited object
colors, shows significant quantitative and qualitative advancements over
competitors, accelerating speeds by 5x to 500x.

**Abstract**: Photorealistic 3D reconstruction of street scenes is a critical technique for
developing real-world simulators for autonomous driving. Despite the efficacy
of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for driving scenes, 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) emerges as a promising direction due to its faster speed and more
explicit representation. However, most existing street 3DGS methods require
tracked 3D vehicle bounding boxes to decompose the static and dynamic elements
for effective reconstruction, limiting their applications for in-the-wild
scenarios. To facilitate efficient 3D scene reconstruction without costly
annotations, we propose a self-supervised street Gaussian
($\textit{S}^3$Gaussian) method to decompose dynamic and static elements from
4D consistency. We represent each scene with 3D Gaussians to preserve the
explicitness and further accompany them with a spatial-temporal field network
to compactly model the 4D dynamics. We conduct extensive experiments on the
challenging Waymo-Open dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. Our
$\textit{S}^3$Gaussian demonstrates the ability to decompose static and dynamic
scenes and achieves the best performance without using 3D annotations. Code is

## TAMBRIDGE: Bridging Frame-Centered Tracking and 3D Gaussian Splatting  for Enhanced SLAM

**Abstract**: The limited robustness of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to motion blur and
camera noise, along with its poor real-time performance, restricts its
application in robotic SLAM tasks. Upon analysis, the primary causes of these
issues are the density of views with motion blur and the cumulative errors in
dense pose estimation from calculating losses based on noisy original images
and rendering results, which increase the difficulty of 3DGS rendering
convergence. Thus, a cutting-edge 3DGS-based SLAM system is introduced,
leveraging the efficiency and flexibility of 3DGS to achieve real-time
performance while remaining robust against sensor noise, motion blur, and the
challenges posed by long-session SLAM. Central to this approach is the Fusion
Bridge module, which seamlessly integrates tracking-centered ORB Visual
Odometry with mapping-centered online 3DGS. Precise pose initialization is
enabled by this module through joint optimization of re-projection and
rendering loss, as well as strategic view selection, enhancing rendering
convergence in large-scale scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art rendering quality and localization accuracy, positioning this
system as a promising solution for real-world robotics applications that
require stable, near-real-time performance. Our project is available at

## HINT: Learning Complete Human Neural Representations from Limited  Viewpoints

**Abstract**: No augmented application is possible without animated humanoid avatars. At
the same time, generating human replicas from real-world monocular hand-held or
robotic sensor setups is challenging due to the limited availability of views.
Previous work showed the feasibility of virtual avatars but required the
presence of 360 degree views of the targeted subject. To address this issue, we
propose HINT, a NeRF-based algorithm able to learn a detailed and complete
human model from limited viewing angles. We achieve this by introducing a
symmetry prior, regularization constraints, and training cues from large human
datasets. In particular, we introduce a sagittal plane symmetry prior to the
appearance of the human, directly supervise the density function of the human
model using explicit 3D body modeling, and leverage a co-learned human
digitization network as additional supervision for the unseen angles. As a
result, our method can reconstruct complete humans even from a few viewing
angles, increasing performance by more than 15% PSNR compared to previous
state-of-the-art algorithms.

## A Pixel Is Worth More Than One 3D Gaussians in Single-View 3D  Reconstruction

**Abstract**: Learning 3D scene representation from a single-view image is a long-standing
fundamental problem in computer vision, with the inherent ambiguity in
predicting contents unseen from the input view. Built on the recently proposed
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), the Splatter Image method has made promising
progress on fast single-image novel view synthesis via learning a single 3D
Gaussian for each pixel based on the U-Net feature map of an input image.
However, it has limited expressive power to represent occluded components that
are not observable in the input view. To address this problem, this paper
presents a Hierarchical Splatter Image method in which a pixel is worth more
than one 3D Gaussians. Specifically, each pixel is represented by a parent 3D
Gaussian and a small number of child 3D Gaussians. Parent 3D Gaussians are
learned as done in the vanilla Splatter Image. Child 3D Gaussians are learned
via a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) which takes as input the
projected image features of a parent 3D Gaussian and the embedding of a target
camera view. Both parent and child 3D Gaussians are learned end-to-end in a
stage-wise way. The joint condition of input image features from eyes of the
parent Gaussians and the target camera position facilitates learning to
allocate child Gaussians to ``see the unseen'', recovering the occluded details
that are often missed by parent Gaussians.
  In experiments, the proposed method is tested on the ShapeNet-SRN and CO3D
datasets with state-of-the-art performance obtained, especially showing
promising capabilities of reconstructing occluded contents in the input view.

**Abstract**: As text-conditioned diffusion models (DMs) achieve breakthroughs in image,
video, and 3D generation, the research community's focus has shifted to the
more challenging task of text-to-4D synthesis, which introduces a temporal
dimension to generate dynamic 3D objects. In this context, we identify Score
Distillation Sampling (SDS), a widely used technique for text-to-3D synthesis,
as a significant hindrance to text-to-4D performance due to its Janus-faced and
texture-unrealistic problems coupled with high computational costs. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{P}ixel-\textbf{L}evel \textbf{A}lignments for
Text-to-\textbf{4D} Gaussian Splatting (\textbf{PLA4D}), a novel method that
utilizes text-to-video frames as explicit pixel alignment targets to generate
static 3D objects and inject motion into them. Specifically, we introduce Focal
Alignment to calibrate camera poses for rendering and GS-Mesh Contrastive
Learning to distill geometry priors from rendered image contrasts at the pixel
level. Additionally, we develop Motion Alignment using a deformation network to
drive changes in Gaussians and implement Reference Refinement for smooth 4D
object surfaces. These techniques enable 4D Gaussian Splatting to align
geometry, texture, and motion with generated videos at the pixel level.
Compared to previous methods, PLA4D produces synthesized outputs with better
texture details in less time and effectively mitigates the Janus-faced problem.
PLA4D is fully implemented using open-source models, offering an accessible,
user-friendly, and promising direction for 4D digital content creation. Our

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian splatting has demonstrated impressive performance in real-time
novel view synthesis. However, achieving successful reconstruction from RGB
images generally requires multiple input views captured under static
conditions. To address the challenge of sparse input views, previous approaches
have incorporated depth supervision into the training of 3D Gaussians to
mitigate overfitting, using dense predictions from pretrained depth networks as
pseudo-ground truth. Nevertheless, depth predictions from monocular depth
estimation models inherently exhibit significant uncertainty in specific areas.
Relying solely on pixel-wise L2 loss may inadvertently incorporate detrimental
noise from these uncertain areas. In this work, we introduce a novel method to
supervise the depth distribution of 3D Gaussians, utilizing depth priors with
integrated uncertainty estimates. To address these localized errors in depth
predictions, we integrate a patch-wise optimal transport strategy to complement
traditional L2 loss in depth supervision. Extensive experiments conducted on
the LLFF, DTU, and Blender datasets demonstrate that our approach, UGOT,
achieves superior novel view synthesis and consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown remarkable success in synthesizing
photorealistic views from multi-view images of static scenes, but face
challenges in dynamic, real-world environments with distractors like moving
objects, shadows, and lighting changes. Existing methods manage controlled
environments and low occlusion ratios but fall short in render quality,
especially under high occlusion scenarios. In this paper, we introduce NeRF
On-the-go, a simple yet effective approach that enables the robust synthesis of
novel views in complex, in-the-wild scenes from only casually captured image
sequences. Delving into uncertainty, our method not only efficiently eliminates
distractors, even when they are predominant in captures, but also achieves a
notably faster convergence speed. Through comprehensive experiments on various
scenes, our method demonstrates a significant improvement over state-of-the-art
techniques. This advancement opens new avenues for NeRF in diverse and dynamic
real-world applications.

**Abstract**: Enabling the synthesis of arbitrarily novel viewpoint images within a
patient's stomach from pre-captured monocular gastroscopic images is a
promising topic in stomach diagnosis. Typical methods to achieve this objective
integrate traditional 3D reconstruction techniques, including
structure-from-motion (SfM) and Poisson surface reconstruction. These methods
produce explicit 3D representations, such as point clouds and meshes, thereby
enabling the rendering of the images from novel viewpoints. However, the
existence of low-texture and non-Lambertian regions within the stomach often
results in noisy and incomplete reconstructions of point clouds and meshes,
hindering the attainment of high-quality image rendering. In this paper, we
apply the emerging technique of neural radiance fields (NeRF) to monocular
gastroscopic data for synthesizing photo-realistic images for novel viewpoints.
To address the performance degradation due to view sparsity in local regions of
monocular gastroscopy, we incorporate geometry priors from a pre-reconstructed
point cloud into the training of NeRF, which introduces a novel geometry-based
loss to both pre-captured observed views and generated unobserved views.
Compared to other recent NeRF methods, our approach showcases high-fidelity
image renderings from novel viewpoints within the stomach both qualitatively
and quantitatively.

## LP-3DGS: Learning to Prune 3D Gaussian Splatting

**Abstract**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the mainstream
methodologies for novel view synthesis (NVS) due to its high quality and fast
rendering speed. However, as a point-based scene representation, 3DGS
potentially generates a large number of Gaussians to fit the scene, leading to
high memory usage. Improvements that have been proposed require either an
empirical and preset pruning ratio or importance score threshold to prune the
point cloud. Such hyperparamter requires multiple rounds of training to
optimize and achieve the maximum pruning ratio, while maintaining the rendering
quality for each scene. In this work, we propose learning-to-prune 3DGS
(LP-3DGS), where a trainable binary mask is applied to the importance score
that can find optimal pruning ratio automatically. Instead of using the
traditional straight-through estimator (STE) method to approximate the binary
mask gradient, we redesign the masking function to leverage the Gumbel-Sigmoid
method, making it differentiable and compatible with the existing training
process of 3DGS. Extensive experiments have shown that LP-3DGS consistently
produces a good balance that is both efficient and high quality.

components into our everyday lives. Constructing such avatars is a challenging
research problem, due to a high demand for photo-realism and real-time
rendering performance. In this work, we propose Neural Parametric Gaussian
Avatars (NPGA), a data-driven approach to create high-fidelity, controllable
avatars from multi-view video recordings. We build our method around 3D
Gaussian Splatting for its highly efficient rendering and to inherit the
topological flexibility of point clouds. In contrast to previous work, we
condition our avatars' dynamics on the rich expression space of neural
parametric head models (NPHM), instead of mesh-based 3DMMs. To this end, we
distill the backward deformation field of our underlying NPHM into forward
deformations which are compatible with rasterization-based rendering. All
remaining fine-scale, expression-dependent details are learned from the
multi-view videos. To increase the representational capacity of our avatars, we
augment the canonical Gaussian point cloud using per-primitive latent features
which govern its dynamic behavior. To regularize this increased dynamic
expressivity, we propose Laplacian terms on the latent features and predicted
dynamics. We evaluate our method on the public NeRSemble dataset, demonstrating
that NPGA significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art avatars on
the self-reenactment task by 2.6 PSNR. Furthermore, we demonstrate accurate
animation capabilities from real-world monocular videos.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has demonstrated exceptional capabilities in 3D
scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, its training heavily
depends on high-quality, sharp images and accurate camera poses. Fulfilling
these requirements can be challenging in non-ideal real-world scenarios, where
motion-blurred images are commonly encountered in high-speed moving cameras or
low-light environments that require long exposure times. To address these
challenges, we introduce Event Stream Assisted Gaussian Splatting
(EvaGaussians), a novel approach that integrates event streams captured by an
event camera to assist in reconstructing high-quality 3D-GS from blurry images.
Capitalizing on the high temporal resolution and dynamic range offered by the
event camera, we leverage the event streams to explicitly model the formation
process of motion-blurred images and guide the deblurring reconstruction of
3D-GS. By jointly optimizing the 3D-GS parameters and recovering camera motion
trajectories during the exposure time, our method can robustly facilitate the
acquisition of high-fidelity novel views with intricate texture details. We
comprehensively evaluated our method and compared it with previous
state-of-the-art deblurring rendering methods. Both qualitative and
quantitative comparisons demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
techniques in restoring fine details from blurry images and producing
high-fidelity novel views.

**Abstract**: In recent years, the increasing demand for dynamic 3D assets in design and
gaming applications has given rise to powerful generative pipelines capable of
synthesizing high-quality 4D objects. Previous methods generally rely on score
distillation sampling (SDS) algorithm to infer the unseen views and motion of
4D objects, thus leading to unsatisfactory results with defects like
over-saturation and Janus problem. Therefore, inspired by recent progress of
video diffusion models, we propose to optimize a 4D representation by
explicitly generating multi-view videos from one input image. However, it is
far from trivial to handle practical challenges faced by such a pipeline,
including dramatic temporal inconsistency, inter-frame geometry and texture
diversity, and semantic defects brought by video generation results. To address
these issues, we propose DG4D, a novel multi-stage framework that generates
high-quality and consistent 4D assets without score distillation. Specifically,
collaborative techniques and solutions are developed, including an attention
injection strategy to synthesize temporal-consistent multi-view videos, a
robust and efficient dynamic reconstruction method based on Gaussian Splatting,
and a refinement stage with diffusion prior for semantic restoration. The
qualitative results and user preference study demonstrate that our framework
outperforms the baselines in generation quality by a considerable margin. Code

**Abstract**: One of the key advantages of 3D rendering is its ability to simulate
intricate scenes accurately. One of the most widely used methods for this
purpose is Gaussian Splatting, a novel approach that is known for its rapid
training and inference capabilities. In essence, Gaussian Splatting involves
incorporating data about the 3D objects of interest into a series of Gaussian
distributions, each of which can then be depicted in 3D in a manner analogous
to traditional meshes. It is regrettable that the use of Gaussians in Gaussian
Splatting is currently somewhat restrictive due to their perceived linear
nature. In practice, 3D objects are often composed of complex curves and highly
nonlinear structures. This issue can to some extent be alleviated by employing
a multitude of Gaussian components to reflect the complex, nonlinear structures
accurately. However, this approach results in a considerable increase in time
complexity. This paper introduces the concept of negative Gaussians, which are
interpreted as items with negative colors. The rationale behind this approach
is based on the density distribution created by dividing the probability
density functions (PDFs) of two Gaussians, which we refer to as Diff-Gaussian.
Such a distribution can be used to approximate structures such as donut and
moon-shaped datasets. Experimental findings indicate that the application of
these techniques enhances the modeling of high-frequency elements with rapid
color transitions. Additionally, it improves the representation of shadows. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to extend the simple
elipsoid shapes of Gaussian Splatting to more complex nonlinear structures.

**Abstract**: Tissue deformation poses a key challenge for accurate surgical scene
reconstruction. Despite yielding high reconstruction quality, existing methods
suffer from slow rendering speeds and long training times, limiting their
intraoperative applicability. Motivated by recent progress in 3D Gaussian
Splatting, an emerging technology in real-time 3D rendering, this work presents
a novel fast reconstruction framework, termed Deform3DGS, for deformable
tissues during endoscopic surgery. Specifically, we introduce 3D GS into
surgical scenes by integrating a point cloud initialization to improve
reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a novel flexible deformation modeling
scheme (FDM) to learn tissue deformation dynamics at the level of individual
Gaussians. Our FDM can model the surface deformation with efficient
representations, allowing for real-time rendering performance. More
importantly, FDM significantly accelerates surgical scene reconstruction,
demonstrating considerable clinical values, particularly in intraoperative
settings where time efficiency is crucial. Experiments on DaVinci robotic
surgery videos indicate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing superior
reconstruction fidelity PSNR: (37.90) and rendering speed (338.8 FPS) while
substantially reducing training time to only 1 minute/scene. Our code is

**Abstract**: We present a grid-free fluid solver featuring a novel Gaussian
representation. Drawing inspiration from the expressive capabilities of 3D
Gaussian Splatting in multi-view image reconstruction, we model the continuous
flow velocity as a weighted sum of multiple Gaussian functions. Leveraging this
representation, we derive differential operators for the field and implement a
time-dependent PDE solver using the traditional operator splitting method.
Compared to implicit neural representations as another continuous spatial
representation with increasing attention, our method with flexible 3D Gaussians
presents enhanced accuracy on vorticity preservation. Moreover, we apply
physics-driven strategies to accelerate the optimization-based time integration
of Gaussian functions. This temporal evolution surpasses previous work based on
implicit neural representation with reduced computational time and memory.
Although not surpassing the quality of state-of-the-art Eulerian methods in
fluid simulation, experiments and ablation studies indicate the potential of
our memory-efficient representation. With enriched spatial information, our
method exhibits a distinctive perspective combining the advantages of Eulerian
and Lagrangian approaches.

**Abstract**: Neural 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), excel at
producing photo-realistic rendering results but lack the flexibility for
manipulation and editing which is crucial for content creation. Previous works
have attempted to address this issue by deforming a NeRF in canonical space or
manipulating the radiance field based on an explicit mesh. However,
manipulating NeRF is not highly controllable and requires a long training and
inference time. With the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), extremely
high-fidelity novel view synthesis can be achieved using an explicit
point-based 3D representation with much faster training and rendering speed.
However, there is still a lack of effective means to manipulate 3DGS freely
while maintaining rendering quality. In this work, we aim to tackle the
challenge of achieving manipulable photo-realistic rendering. We propose to
utilize a triangular mesh to manipulate 3DGS directly with self-adaptation.
This approach reduces the need to design various algorithms for different types
of Gaussian manipulation. By utilizing a triangle shape-aware Gaussian binding
and adapting method, we can achieve 3DGS manipulation and preserve
high-fidelity rendering after manipulation. Our approach is capable of handling
large deformations, local manipulations, and soft body simulations while
keeping high-quality rendering. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is
also effective with inaccurate meshes extracted from 3DGS. Experiments
conducted demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over
baseline approaches.

## SafeguardGS: 3D Gaussian Primitive Pruning While Avoiding Catastrophic  Scene Destruction

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has made a significant stride in novel view
synthesis, demonstrating top-notch rendering quality while achieving real-time
rendering speed. However, the excessively large number of Gaussian primitives
resulting from 3DGS' suboptimal densification process poses a major challenge,
slowing down frame-per-second (FPS) and demanding considerable memory cost,
making it unfavorable for low-end devices. To cope with this issue, many
follow-up studies have suggested various pruning techniques, often in
combination with different score functions, to optimize rendering performance.
Nonetheless, a comprehensive discussion regarding their effectiveness and
implications across all techniques is missing. In this paper, we first
categorize 3DGS pruning techniques into two types: Cross-view pruning and
pixel-wise pruning, which differ in their approaches to rank primitives. Our
subsequent experiments reveal that while cross-view pruning leads to disastrous
quality drops under extreme Gaussian primitives decimation, the pixel-wise
pruning technique not only sustains relatively high rendering quality with
minuscule performance degradation but also provides a reasonable minimum
boundary for pruning. Building on this observation, we further propose multiple
variations of score functions and empirically discover that the color-weighted
score function outperforms others for discriminating insignificant primitives
for rendering. We believe our research provides valuable insights for
optimizing 3DGS pruning strategies for future works.

**Abstract**: In autonomous driving, multi-modal perception models leveraging inputs from
multiple sensors exhibit strong robustness in degraded environments. However,
these models face challenges in efficiently and effectively transferring
learned representations across different modalities and tasks. This paper
presents NeRF-Supervised Masked Auto Encoder (NS-MAE), a self-supervised
pre-training paradigm for transferable multi-modal representation learning.
NS-MAE is designed to provide pre-trained model initializations for efficient
and high-performance fine-tuning. Our approach uses masked multi-modal
reconstruction in neural radiance fields (NeRF), training the model to
reconstruct missing or corrupted input data across multiple modalities.
Specifically, multi-modal embeddings are extracted from corrupted LiDAR point
clouds and images, conditioned on specific view directions and locations. These
embeddings are then rendered into projected multi-modal feature maps using
neural rendering techniques. The original multi-modal signals serve as
reconstruction targets for the rendered feature maps, facilitating
self-supervised representation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
promising transferability of NS-MAE representations across diverse multi-modal
and single-modal perception models. This transferability is evaluated on
various 3D perception downstream tasks, such as 3D object detection and BEV map
segmentation, using different amounts of fine-tuning labeled data. Our code
will be released to support the community.

**Abstract**: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has revolutionized
three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction with its implicit representation.
Building upon NeRF, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has departed from the
implicit representation of neural networks and instead directly represents
scenes as point clouds with Gaussian-shaped distributions. While this shift has
notably elevated the rendering quality and speed of radiance fields but
inevitably led to a significant increase in memory usage. Additionally,
effectively rendering dynamic scenes in 3D-GS has emerged as a pressing
challenge. To address these concerns, this paper purposes a refined 3D Gaussian
representation for high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction. Firstly, we use a
deformable multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network to capture the dynamic offset
of Gaussian points and express the color features of points through hash
encoding and a tiny MLP to reduce storage requirements. Subsequently, we
introduce a learnable denoising mask coupled with denoising loss to eliminate
noise points from the scene, thereby further compressing 3D Gaussian model.
Finally, motion noise of points is mitigated through static constraints and
motion consistency constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method surpasses existing approaches in rendering quality and speed, while
significantly reducing the memory usage associated with 3D-GS, making it highly
suitable for various tasks such as novel view synthesis, and dynamic mapping.

**Abstract**: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery benefits from enhancing dynamic
scene reconstruction, as it improves surgical outcomes. While Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) have been effective in scene reconstruction, their slow inference
speeds and lengthy training durations limit their applicability. To overcome
these limitations, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based methods have emerged as
a recent trend, offering rapid inference capabilities and superior 3D quality.
However, these methods still struggle with under-reconstruction in both static
and dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose HFGS, a novel approach for
deformable endoscopic reconstruction that addresses these challenges from
spatial and temporal frequency perspectives. Our approach incorporates
deformation fields to better handle dynamic scenes and introduces Spatial
High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (SHF) to minimize discrepancies in
spatial frequency spectra between the rendered image and its ground truth.
Additionally, we introduce Temporal High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction
(THF) to enhance dynamic awareness in neural rendering by leveraging flow
priors, focusing optimization on motion-intensive parts. Extensive experiments
on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that HFGS achieves superior rendering
quality. Our code will be available.

**Abstract**: Reconstructing 4D scenes from video inputs is a crucial yet challenging task.
Conventional methods usually rely on the assumptions of multi-view video
inputs, known camera parameters, or static scenes, all of which are typically
absent under in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we relax all these
constraints and tackle a highly ambitious but practical task, which we termed
as AnyV4D: we assume only one monocular video is available without any camera
parameters as input, and we aim to recover the dynamic 4D world alongside the
camera poses. To this end, we introduce GFlow, a new framework that utilizes
only 2D priors (depth and optical flow) to lift a video (3D) to a 4D explicit
representation, entailing a flow of Gaussian splatting through space and time.
GFlow first clusters the scene into still and moving parts, then applies a
sequential optimization process that optimizes camera poses and the dynamics of
3D Gaussian points based on 2D priors and scene clustering, ensuring fidelity
among neighboring points and smooth movement across frames. Since dynamic
scenes always introduce new content, we also propose a new pixel-wise
densification strategy for Gaussian points to integrate new visual content.
Moreover, GFlow transcends the boundaries of mere 4D reconstruction; it also
enables tracking of any points across frames without the need for prior
training and segments moving objects from the scene in an unsupervised way.
Additionally, the camera poses of each frame can be derived from GFlow,
allowing for rendering novel views of a video scene through changing camera
pose. By employing the explicit representation, we may readily conduct
scene-level or object-level editing as desired, underscoring its versatility
and power. Visit our project website at: https://littlepure2333.github.io/GFlow

**Abstract**: Empowering 3D Gaussian Splatting with generalization ability is appealing.
However, existing generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting methods are largely
confined to narrow-range interpolation between stereo images due to their heavy
backbones, thus lacking the ability to accurately localize 3D Gaussian and
support free-view synthesis across wide view range. In this paper, we present a
novel framework FreeSplat that is capable of reconstructing geometrically
consistent 3D scenes from long sequence input towards free-view
synthesis.Specifically, we firstly introduce Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation
achieved by constructing adaptive cost volumes among nearby views and
aggregating features using a multi-scale structure. Subsequently, we present
the Pixel-wise Triplet Fusion to eliminate redundancy of 3D Gaussians in
overlapping view regions and to aggregate features observed across multiple
views. Additionally, we propose a simple but effective free-view training
strategy that ensures robust view synthesis across broader view range
regardless of the number of views. Our empirical results demonstrate
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis peformances in both novel view rendered
color maps quality and depth maps accuracy across different numbers of input
views. We also show that FreeSplat performs inference more efficiently and can
effectively reduce redundant Gaussians, offering the possibility of
feed-forward large scene reconstruction without depth priors.

**Abstract**: Unveiling an empty street from crowded observations captured by in-car
cameras is crucial for autonomous driving. However, removing all temporarily
static objects, such as stopped vehicles and standing pedestrians, presents a
significant challenge. Unlike object-centric 3D inpainting, which relies on
thorough observation in a small scene, street scene cases involve long
trajectories that differ from previous 3D inpainting tasks. The camera-centric
moving environment of captured videos further complicates the task due to the
limited degree and time duration of object observation. To address these
obstacles, we introduce StreetUnveiler to reconstruct an empty street.
StreetUnveiler learns a 3D representation of the empty street from crowded
observations. Our representation is based on the hard-label semantic 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) for its scalability and ability to identify Gaussians
to be removed. We inpaint rendered image after removing unwanted Gaussians to
provide pseudo-labels and subsequently re-optimize the 2DGS. Given its temporal
continuous movement, we divide the empty street scene into observed,
partial-observed, and unobserved regions, which we propose to locate through a
rendered alpha map. This decomposition helps us to minimize the regions that
need to be inpainted. To enhance the temporal consistency of the inpainting, we
introduce a novel time-reversal framework to inpaint frames in reverse order
and use later frames as references for earlier frames to fully utilize the
long-trajectory observations. Our experiments conducted on the street scene
dataset successfully reconstructed a 3D representation of the empty street. The
mesh representation of the empty street can be extracted for further
applications. The project page and more visualizations can be found at:

**Abstract**: Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized the world of novel view synthesis by
achieving high rendering performance in real-time. Recently, studies have
focused on enriching these 3D representations with semantic information for
downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce RT-GS2, the first generalizable
semantic segmentation method employing Gaussian Splatting. While existing
Gaussian Splatting-based approaches rely on scene-specific training, RT-GS2
demonstrates the ability to generalize to unseen scenes. Our method adopts a
new approach by first extracting view-independent 3D Gaussian features in a
self-supervised manner, followed by a novel View-Dependent / View-Independent
(VDVI) feature fusion to enhance semantic consistency over different views.
Extensive experimentation on three different datasets showcases RT-GS2's
superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation quality,
exemplified by a 8.01% increase in mIoU on the Replica dataset. Moreover, our
method achieves real-time performance of 27.03 FPS, marking an astonishing 901
times speedup compared to existing approaches. This work represents a
significant advancement in the field by introducing, to the best of our
knowledge, the first real-time generalizable semantic segmentation method for
3D Gaussian representations of radiance fields.

**Abstract**: Scene image editing is crucial for entertainment, photography, and
advertising design. Existing methods solely focus on either 2D individual
object or 3D global scene editing. This results in a lack of a unified approach
to effectively control and manipulate scenes at the 3D level with different
levels of granularity. In this work, we propose 3DitScene, a novel and unified
scene editing framework leveraging language-guided disentangled Gaussian
Splatting that enables seamless editing from 2D to 3D, allowing precise control
over scene composition and individual objects. We first incorporate 3D
Gaussians that are refined through generative priors and optimization
techniques. Language features from CLIP then introduce semantics into 3D
geometry for object disentanglement. With the disentangled Gaussians, 3DitScene
allows for manipulation at both the global and individual levels,
revolutionizing creative expression and empowering control over scenes and
objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of
3DitScene in scene image editing. Code and online demo can be found at our

**Abstract**: The neural radiance field (NeRF) has made significant strides in representing
3D scenes and synthesizing novel views. Despite its advancements, the high
computational costs of NeRF have posed challenges for its deployment in
resource-constrained environments and real-time applications. As an alternative
to NeRF-like neural rendering methods, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers
rapid rendering speeds while maintaining excellent image quality. However, as
it represents objects and scenes using a myriad of Gaussians, it requires
substantial storage to achieve high-quality representation. To mitigate the
storage overhead, we propose Factorized 3D Gaussian Splatting (F-3DGS), a novel
approach that drastically reduces storage requirements while preserving image
quality. Inspired by classical matrix and tensor factorization techniques, our
method represents and approximates dense clusters of Gaussians with
significantly fewer Gaussians through efficient factorization. We aim to
efficiently represent dense 3D Gaussians by approximating them with a limited
amount of information for each axis and their combinations. This method allows
us to encode a substantially large number of Gaussians along with their
essential attributes -- such as color, scale, and rotation -- necessary for
rendering using a relatively small number of elements. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that F-3DGS achieves a significant reduction in storage
costs while maintaining comparable quality in rendered images.

of scenarios. Dash cam videos often suffer from severe obstructions such as
reflections and occlusions on the windshields, which significantly impede the
application of neural rendering techniques. To address this challenge, we
develop DC-Gaussian based on the recent real-time neural rendering technique 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our approach includes an adaptive image
decomposition module to model reflections and occlusions in a unified manner.
Additionally, we introduce illumination-aware obstruction modeling to manage
reflections and occlusions under varying lighting conditions. Lastly, we employ
a geometry-guided Gaussian enhancement strategy to improve rendering details by
incorporating additional geometry priors. Experiments on self-captured and
public dash cam videos show that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art
performance in novel view synthesis, but also accurately reconstructing
captured scenes getting rid of obstructions.

**Abstract**: With the emergence of Gaussian Splats, recent efforts have focused on
large-scale scene geometric reconstruction. However, most of these efforts
either concentrate on memory reduction or spatial space division, neglecting
information in the semantic space. In this paper, we propose a novel method,
named SA-GS, for fine-grained 3D geometry reconstruction using semantic-aware
3D Gaussian Splats. Specifically, we leverage prior information stored in large
vision models such as SAM and DINO to generate semantic masks. We then
introduce a geometric complexity measurement function to serve as soft
regularization, guiding the shape of each Gaussian Splat within specific
semantic areas. Additionally, we present a method that estimates the expected
number of Gaussian Splats in different semantic areas, effectively providing a
lower bound for Gaussian Splats in these areas. Subsequently, we extract the
point cloud using a novel probability density-based extraction method,
transforming Gaussian Splats into a point cloud crucial for downstream tasks.
Our method also offers the potential for detailed semantic inquiries while
maintaining high image-based reconstruction results. We provide extensive
experiments on publicly available large-scale scene reconstruction datasets
with highly accurate point clouds as ground truth and our novel dataset. Our
results demonstrate the superiority of our method over current state-of-the-art
Gaussian Splats reconstruction methods by a significant margin in terms of
geometric-based measurement metrics. Code and additional results will soon be

**Abstract**: 3D open-vocabulary scene understanding, crucial for advancing augmented
reality and robotic applications, involves interpreting and locating specific
regions within a 3D space as directed by natural language instructions. To this
end, we introduce GOI, a framework that integrates semantic features from 2D
vision-language foundation models into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and
identifies 3D Gaussians of Interest using an Optimizable Semantic-space
Hyperplane. Our approach includes an efficient compression method that utilizes
scene priors to condense noisy high-dimensional semantic features into compact
low-dimensional vectors, which are subsequently embedded in 3DGS. During the
open-vocabulary querying process, we adopt a distinct approach compared to
existing methods, which depend on a manually set fixed empirical threshold to
select regions based on their semantic feature distance to the query text
embedding. This traditional approach often lacks universal accuracy, leading to
challenges in precisely identifying specific target areas. Instead, our method
treats the feature selection process as a hyperplane division within the
feature space, retaining only those features that are highly relevant to the
query. We leverage off-the-shelf 2D Referring Expression Segmentation (RES)
models to fine-tune the semantic-space hyperplane, enabling a more precise
distinction between target regions and others. This fine-tuning substantially
improves the accuracy of open-vocabulary queries, ensuring the precise
localization of pertinent 3D Gaussians. Extensive experiments demonstrate GOI's
superiority over previous state-of-the-art methods. Our project page is

**Abstract**: We introduce 4D Motion Scaffolds (MoSca), a neural information processing
system designed to reconstruct and synthesize novel views of dynamic scenes
from monocular videos captured casually in the wild. To address such a
challenging and ill-posed inverse problem, we leverage prior knowledge from
foundational vision models, lift the video data to a novel Motion Scaffold
(MoSca) representation, which compactly and smoothly encodes the underlying
motions / deformations. The scene geometry and appearance are then disentangled
from the deformation field, and are encoded by globally fusing the Gaussians
anchored onto the MoSca and optimized via Gaussian Splatting. Additionally,
camera poses can be seamlessly initialized and refined during the dynamic
rendering process, without the need for other pose estimation tools.
Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on dynamic rendering
benchmarks.

**Abstract**: Humans naturally retain memories of permanent elements, while ephemeral
moments often slip through the cracks of memory. This selective retention is
crucial for robotic perception, localization, and mapping. To endow robots with
this capability, we introduce 3D Gaussian Mapping (3DGM), a self-supervised,
camera-only offline mapping framework grounded in 3D Gaussian Splatting. 3DGM
converts multitraverse RGB videos from the same region into a Gaussian-based
environmental map while concurrently performing 2D ephemeral object
segmentation. Our key observation is that the environment remains consistent
across traversals, while objects frequently change. This allows us to exploit
self-supervision from repeated traversals to achieve environment-object
decomposition. More specifically, 3DGM formulates multitraverse environmental
mapping as a robust differentiable rendering problem, treating pixels of the
environment and objects as inliers and outliers, respectively. Using robust
feature distillation, feature residuals mining, and robust optimization, 3DGM
jointly performs 3D mapping and 2D segmentation without human intervention. We
build the Mapverse benchmark, sourced from the Ithaca365 and nuPlan datasets,
to evaluate our method in unsupervised 2D segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and
neural rendering. Extensive results verify the effectiveness and potential of
our method for self-driving and robotics.

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
synthesizing photorealistic images of large-scale scenes. However, they are
often plagued by a loss of fine details and long rendering durations. 3D
Gaussian Splatting has recently been introduced as a potent alternative,
achieving both high-fidelity visual results and accelerated rendering
performance. Nonetheless, scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting is fraught with
challenges. Specifically, large-scale scenes grapples with the integration of
objects across multiple scales and disparate viewpoints, which often leads to
compromised efficacy as the Gaussians need to balance between detail levels.
Furthermore, the generation of initialization points via COLMAP from
large-scale dataset is both computationally demanding and prone to incomplete
reconstructions. To address these challenges, we present Pyramidal 3D Gaussian
Splatting (PyGS) with NeRF Initialization. Our approach represent the scene
with a hierarchical assembly of Gaussians arranged in a pyramidal fashion. The
top level of the pyramid is composed of a few large Gaussians, while each
subsequent layer accommodates a denser collection of smaller Gaussians. We
effectively initialize these pyramidal Gaussians through sampling a rapidly
trained grid-based NeRF at various frequencies. We group these pyramidal
Gaussians into clusters and use a compact weighting network to dynamically
determine the influence of each pyramid level of each cluster considering
camera viewpoint during rendering. Our method achieves a significant
performance leap across multiple large-scale datasets and attains a rendering
time that is over 400 times faster than current state-of-the-art approaches.

## DOF-GS: Adjustable Depth-of-Field 3D Gaussian Splatting for  Refocusing,Defocus Rendering and Blur Removal

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting-based techniques have recently advanced 3D scene
reconstruction and novel view synthesis, achieving high-quality real-time
rendering. However, these approaches are inherently limited by the underlying
pinhole camera assumption in modeling the images and hence only work for
All-in-Focus (AiF) sharp image inputs. This severely affects their
applicability in real-world scenarios where images often exhibit defocus blur
due to the limited depth-of-field (DOF) of imaging devices. Additionally,
existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods also do not support rendering of
DOF effects.
  To address these challenges, we introduce DOF-GS that allows for rendering
adjustable DOF effects, removing defocus blur as well as refocusing of 3D
scenes, all from multi-view images degraded by defocus blur. To this end, we
re-imagine the traditional Gaussian Splatting pipeline by employing a finite
aperture camera model coupled with explicit, differentiable defocus rendering
guided by the Circle-of-Confusion (CoC). The proposed framework provides for
dynamic adjustment of DOF effects by changing the aperture and focal distance
of the underlying camera model on-demand. It also enables rendering varying DOF
effects of 3D scenes post-optimization, and generating AiF images from
defocused training images. Furthermore, we devise a joint optimization strategy
to further enhance details in the reconstructed scenes by jointly optimizing
rendered defocused and AiF images. Our experimental results indicate that
DOF-GS produces high-quality sharp all-in-focus renderings conditioned on
inputs compromised by defocus blur, with the training process incurring only a
modest increase in GPU memory consumption. We further demonstrate the
applications of the proposed method for adjustable defocus rendering and
refocusing of the 3D scene from input images degraded by defocus blur.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful representation of geometry
and appearance for RGB-only dense Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM),
as it provides a compact dense map representation while enabling efficient and
high-quality map rendering. However, existing methods show significantly worse
reconstruction quality than competing methods using other 3D representations,
e.g. neural points clouds, since they either do not employ global map and pose
optimization or make use of monocular depth. In response, we propose the first
RGB-only SLAM system with a dense 3D Gaussian map representation that utilizes
all benefits of globally optimized tracking by adapting dynamically to keyframe
pose and depth updates by actively deforming the 3D Gaussian map. Moreover, we
find that refining the depth updates in inaccurate areas with a monocular depth
estimator further improves the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction. Our
experiments on the Replica, TUM-RGBD, and ScanNet datasets indicate the
effectiveness of globally optimized 3D Gaussians, as the approach achieves
superior or on par performance with existing RGB-only SLAM methods methods in
tracking, mapping and rendering accuracy while yielding small map sizes and
fast runtimes. The source code is available at

**Abstract**: The availability of large-scale multimodal datasets and advancements in
diffusion models have significantly accelerated progress in 4D content
generation. Most prior approaches rely on multiple image or video diffusion
models, utilizing score distillation sampling for optimization or generating
pseudo novel views for direct supervision. However, these methods are hindered
by slow optimization speeds and multi-view inconsistency issues. Spatial and
temporal consistency in 4D geometry has been extensively explored respectively
in 3D-aware diffusion models and traditional monocular video diffusion models.
Building on this foundation, we propose a strategy to migrate the temporal
consistency in video diffusion models to the spatial-temporal consistency
required for 4D generation. Specifically, we present a novel framework,
\textbf{Diffusion4D}, for efficient and scalable 4D content generation.
Leveraging a meticulously curated dynamic 3D dataset, we develop a 4D-aware
video diffusion model capable of synthesizing orbital views of dynamic 3D
assets. To control the dynamic strength of these assets, we introduce a
3D-to-4D motion magnitude metric as guidance. Additionally, we propose a novel
motion magnitude reconstruction loss and 3D-aware classifier-free guidance to
refine the learning and generation of motion dynamics. After obtaining orbital
views of the 4D asset, we perform explicit 4D construction with Gaussian
splatting in a coarse-to-fine manner. The synthesized multi-view consistent 4D
image set enables us to swiftly generate high-fidelity and diverse 4D assets
within just several minutes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generation efficiency
and 4D geometry consistency across various prompt modalities.

**Abstract**: We aim to tackle sparse-view reconstruction of a 360 3D scene using priors
from latent diffusion models (LDM). The sparse-view setting is ill-posed and
underconstrained, especially for scenes where the camera rotates 360 degrees
around a point, as no visual information is available beyond some frontal views
focused on the central object(s) of interest. In this work, we show that
pretrained 2D diffusion models can strongly improve the reconstruction of a
scene with low-cost fine-tuning. Specifically, we present SparseSplat360
(Sp2360), a method that employs a cascade of in-painting and artifact removal
models to fill in missing details and clean novel views. Due to superior
training and rendering speeds, we use an explicit scene representation in the
form of 3D Gaussians over NeRF-based implicit representations. We propose an
iterative update strategy to fuse generated pseudo novel views with existing 3D
Gaussians fitted to the initial sparse inputs. As a result, we obtain a
multi-view consistent scene representation with details coherent with the
observed inputs. Our evaluation on the challenging Mip-NeRF360 dataset shows
that our proposed 2D to 3D distillation algorithm considerably improves the
performance of a regularized version of 3DGS adapted to a sparse-view setting
and outperforms existing sparse-view reconstruction methods in 360 scene
reconstruction. Qualitatively, our method generates entire 360 scenes from as
few as 9 input views, with a high degree of foreground and background detail.

**Abstract**: This work introduces Neural Elevations Models (NEMos), which adapt Neural
Radiance Fields to a 2.5D continuous and differentiable terrain model. In
contrast to traditional terrain representations such as digital elevation
models, NEMos can be readily generated from imagery, a low-cost data source,
and provide a lightweight representation of terrain through an implicit
continuous and differentiable height field. We propose a novel method for
jointly training a height field and radiance field within a NeRF framework,
leveraging quantile regression. Additionally, we introduce a path planning
algorithm that performs gradient-based optimization of a continuous cost
function for minimizing distance, slope changes, and control effort, enabled by
differentiability of the height field. We perform experiments on simulated and
real-world terrain imagery, demonstrating NEMos ability to generate
high-quality reconstructions and produce smoother paths compared to discrete
path planning methods. Future work will explore the incorporation of features
and semantics into the height field, creating a generalized terrain model.

**Abstract**: We present GSDeformer, a method that achieves free-form deformation on 3D
Gaussian Splatting(3DGS) without requiring any architectural changes. Our
method extends cage-based deformation, a traditional mesh deformation method,
to 3DGS. This is done by converting 3DGS into a novel proxy point cloud
representation, where its deformation can be used to infer the transformations
to apply on the 3D gaussians making up 3DGS. We also propose an automatic cage
construction algorithm for 3DGS to minimize manual work. Our method does not
modify the underlying architecture of 3DGS. Therefore, any existing trained
vanilla 3DGS can be easily edited by our method. We compare the deformation
capability of our method against other existing methods, demonstrating the ease
of use and comparable quality of our method, despite being more direct and thus
easier to integrate with other concurrent developments on 3DGS.

**Abstract**: Recently, Gaussian Splatting, a method that represents a 3D scene as a
collection of Gaussian distributions, has gained significant attention in
addressing the task of novel view synthesis. In this paper, we highlight a
fundamental limitation of Gaussian Splatting: its inability to accurately
render discontinuities and boundaries in images due to the continuous nature of
Gaussian distributions. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
enabling Gaussian Splatting to perform discontinuity-aware image rendering.
Additionally, we introduce a B\'ezier-boundary gradient approximation strategy
within our framework to keep the ``differentiability'' of the proposed
discontinuity-aware rendering process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of our framework.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a very promising scene representation,
achieving state-of-the-art quality in novel view synthesis significantly faster
than competing alternatives. However, its use of spherical harmonics to
represent scene colors limits the expressivity of 3D Gaussians and, as a
consequence, the capability of the representation to generalize as we move away
from the training views. In this paper, we propose to encode the color
information of 3D Gaussians into per-Gaussian feature vectors, which we denote
as Feature Splatting (FeatSplat). To synthesize a novel view, Gaussians are
first "splatted" into the image plane, then the corresponding feature vectors
are alpha-blended, and finally the blended vector is decoded by a small MLP to
render the RGB pixel values. To further inform the model, we concatenate a
camera embedding to the blended feature vector, to condition the decoding also
on the viewpoint information. Our experiments show that these novel model for
encoding the radiance considerably improves novel view synthesis for low
overlap views that are distant from the training views. Finally, we also show
the capacity and convenience of our feature vector representation,
demonstrating its capability not only to generate RGB values for novel views,
but also their per-pixel semantic labels. We will release the code upon
acceptance.

**Abstract**: High dynamic range (HDR) novel view synthesis (NVS) aims to create
photorealistic images from novel viewpoints using HDR imaging techniques. The
rendered HDR images capture a wider range of brightness levels containing more
details of the scene than normal low dynamic range (LDR) images. Existing HDR
NVS methods are mainly based on NeRF. They suffer from long training time and
slow inference speed. In this paper, we propose a new framework, High Dynamic
Range Gaussian Splatting (HDR-GS), which can efficiently render novel HDR views
and reconstruct LDR images with a user input exposure time. Specifically, we
design a Dual Dynamic Range (DDR) Gaussian point cloud model that uses
spherical harmonics to fit HDR color and employs an MLP-based tone-mapper to
render LDR color. The HDR and LDR colors are then fed into two Parallel
Differentiable Rasterization (PDR) processes to reconstruct HDR and LDR views.
To establish the data foundation for the research of 3D Gaussian
splatting-based methods in HDR NVS, we recalibrate the camera parameters and
compute the initial positions for Gaussian point clouds. Experiments
demonstrate that our HDR-GS surpasses the state-of-the-art NeRF-based method by
3.84 and 1.91 dB on LDR and HDR NVS while enjoying 1000x inference speed and
only requiring 6.3% training time. Code, models, and recalibrated data will be

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has already become the emerging research focus
in the fields of 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Given that
training a 3DGS requires a significant amount of time and computational cost,
it is crucial to protect the copyright, integrity, and privacy of such 3D
assets. Steganography, as a crucial technique for encrypted transmission and
copyright protection, has been extensively studied. However, it still lacks
profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. Unlike its predecessor NeRF, 3DGS
possesses two distinct features: 1) explicit 3D representation; and 2)
real-time rendering speeds. These characteristics result in the 3DGS point
cloud files being public and transparent, with each Gaussian point having a
clear physical significance. Therefore, ensuring the security and fidelity of
the original 3D scene while embedding information into the 3DGS point cloud
files is an extremely challenging task. To solve the above-mentioned issue, we
first propose a steganography framework for 3DGS, dubbed GS-Hider, which can
embed 3D scenes and images into original GS point clouds in an invisible manner
and accurately extract the hidden messages. Specifically, we design a coupled
secured feature attribute to replace the original 3DGS's spherical harmonics
coefficients and then use a scene decoder and a message decoder to disentangle
the original RGB scene and the hidden message. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that the proposed GS-Hider can effectively conceal multimodal
messages without compromising rendering quality and possesses exceptional
security, robustness, capacity, and flexibility. Our project is available at:

**Abstract**: Over the past years, we have observed an abundance of approaches for modeling
dynamic 3D scenes using Gaussian Splatting (GS). Such solutions use GS to
represent the scene's structure and the neural network to model dynamics. Such
approaches allow fast rendering and extracting each element of such a dynamic
scene. However, modifying such objects over time is challenging. SC-GS (Sparse
Controlled Gaussian Splatting) enhanced with Deformed Control Points partially
solves this issue. However, this approach necessitates selecting elements that
need to be kept fixed, as well as centroids that should be adjusted throughout
editing. Moreover, this task poses additional difficulties regarding the
re-productivity of such editing. To address this, we propose Dynamic
Multi-Gaussian Soup (D-MiSo), which allows us to model the mesh-inspired
representation of dynamic GS. Additionally, we propose a strategy of linking
parameterized Gaussian splats, forming a Triangle Soup with the estimated mesh.
Consequently, we can separately construct new trajectories for the 3D objects
composing the scene. Thus, we can make the scene's dynamic editable over time
or while maintaining partial dynamics.

**Abstract**: Camera relocalization is a crucial problem in computer vision and robotics.
Recent advancements in neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have shown promise in
synthesizing photo-realistic images. Several works have utilized NeRFs for
refining camera poses, but they do not account for lighting changes that can
affect scene appearance and shadow regions, causing a degraded pose
optimization process. In this paper, we propose a two-staged pipeline that
normalizes images with varying lighting and shadow conditions to improve camera
relocalization. We implement our scene representation upon a hash-encoded NeRF
which significantly boosts up the pose optimization process. To account for the
noisy image gradient computing problem in grid-based NeRFs, we further propose
a re-devised truncated dynamic low-pass filter (TDLF) and a numerical gradient
averaging technique to smoothen the process. Experimental results on several
datasets with varying lighting conditions demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in camera relocalization under varying lighting
conditions. Code and data will be made publicly available.

**Abstract**: Previous efforts have managed to generate production-ready 3D assets from
text or images. However, these methods primarily employ NeRF or 3D Gaussian
representations, which are not adept at producing smooth, high-quality
geometries required by modern rendering pipelines. In this paper, we propose
LDM, a novel feed-forward framework capable of generating high-fidelity,
illumination-decoupled textured mesh from a single image or text prompts. We
firstly utilize a multi-view diffusion model to generate sparse multi-view
inputs from single images or text prompts, and then a transformer-based model
is trained to predict a tensorial SDF field from these sparse multi-view image
inputs. Finally, we employ a gradient-based mesh optimization layer to refine
this model, enabling it to produce an SDF field from which high-quality
textured meshes can be extracted. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can generate diverse, high-quality 3D mesh assets with corresponding
decomposed RGB textures within seconds.

**Abstract**: Editing objects within a scene is a critical functionality required across a
broad spectrum of applications in computer vision and graphics. As 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) emerges as a frontier in scene representation, the effective
modification of 3D Gaussian scenes has become increasingly vital. This process
entails accurately retrieve the target objects and subsequently performing
modifications based on instructions. Though available in pieces, existing
techniques mainly embed sparse semantics into Gaussians for retrieval, and rely
on an iterative dataset update paradigm for editing, leading to over-smoothing
or inconsistency issues. To this end, this paper proposes a systematic
approach, namely TIGER, for coherent text-instructed 3D Gaussian retrieval and
editing. In contrast to the top-down language grounding approach for 3D
Gaussians, we adopt a bottom-up language aggregation strategy to generate a
denser language embedded 3D Gaussians that supports open-vocabulary retrieval.
To overcome the over-smoothing and inconsistency issues in editing, we propose
a Coherent Score Distillation (CSD) that aggregates a 2D image editing
diffusion model and a multi-view diffusion model for score distillation,
producing multi-view consistent editing with much finer details. In various
experiments, we demonstrate that our TIGER is able to accomplish more
consistent and realistic edits than prior work.

**Abstract**: Novel-view synthesis of specular objects like shiny metals or glossy paints
remains a significant challenge. Not only the glossy appearance but also global
illumination effects, including reflections of other objects in the
environment, are critical components to faithfully reproduce a scene. In this
paper, we present Neural Directional Encoding (NDE), a view-dependent
appearance encoding of neural radiance fields (NeRF) for rendering specular
objects. NDE transfers the concept of feature-grid-based spatial encoding to
the angular domain, significantly improving the ability to model high-frequency
angular signals. In contrast to previous methods that use encoding functions
with only angular input, we additionally cone-trace spatial features to obtain
a spatially varying directional encoding, which addresses the challenging
interreflection effects. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets show that a NeRF model with NDE (1) outperforms the state of the art
on view synthesis of specular objects, and (2) works with small networks to
allow fast (real-time) inference. The project webpage and source code are

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) typically struggle to reconstruct and render
highly specular objects, whose appearance varies quickly with changes in
viewpoint. Recent works have improved NeRF's ability to render detailed
specular appearance of distant environment illumination, but are unable to
synthesize consistent reflections of closer content. Moreover, these techniques
rely on large computationally-expensive neural networks to model outgoing
radiance, which severely limits optimization and rendering speed. We address
these issues with an approach based on ray tracing: instead of querying an
expensive neural network for the outgoing view-dependent radiance at points
along each camera ray, our model casts reflection rays from these points and
traces them through the NeRF representation to render feature vectors which are
decoded into color using a small inexpensive network. We demonstrate that our
model outperforms prior methods for view synthesis of scenes containing shiny
objects, and that it is the only existing NeRF method that can synthesize
photorealistic specular appearance and reflections in real-world scenes, while
requiring comparable optimization time to current state-of-the-art view
synthesis models.

**Abstract**: While controllable generative models for images and videos have achieved
remarkable success, high-quality models for 3D scenes, particularly in
unbounded scenarios like autonomous driving, remain underdeveloped due to high
data acquisition costs. In this paper, we introduce MagicDrive3D, a novel
pipeline for controllable 3D street scene generation that supports
multi-condition control, including BEV maps, 3D objects, and text descriptions.
Unlike previous methods that reconstruct before training the generative models,
MagicDrive3D first trains a video generation model and then reconstructs from
the generated data. This innovative approach enables easily controllable
generation and static scene acquisition, resulting in high-quality scene
reconstruction. To address the minor errors in generated content, we propose
deformable Gaussian splatting with monocular depth initialization and
appearance modeling to manage exposure discrepancies across viewpoints.
Validated on the nuScenes dataset, MagicDrive3D generates diverse, high-quality
3D driving scenes that support any-view rendering and enhance downstream tasks
like BEV segmentation. Our results demonstrate the framework's superior
performance, showcasing its transformative potential for autonomous driving
simulation and beyond.

**Abstract**: Event cameras offer promising advantages such as high dynamic range and low
latency, making them well-suited for challenging lighting conditions and
fast-moving scenarios. However, reconstructing 3D scenes from raw event streams
is difficult because event data is sparse and does not carry absolute color
information. To release its potential in 3D reconstruction, we propose the
first event-based generalizable 3D reconstruction framework, called EvGGS,
which reconstructs scenes as 3D Gaussians from only event input in a
feedforward manner and can generalize to unseen cases without any retraining.
This framework includes a depth estimation module, an intensity reconstruction
module, and a Gaussian regression module. These submodules connect in a
cascading manner, and we collaboratively train them with a designed joint loss
to make them mutually promote. To facilitate related studies, we build a novel
event-based 3D dataset with various material objects and calibrated labels of
grayscale images, depth maps, camera poses, and silhouettes. Experiments show
models that have jointly trained significantly outperform those trained
individually. Our approach performs better than all baselines in reconstruction
quality, and depth/intensity predictions with satisfactory rendering speed.

**Abstract**: Road surface reconstruction plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, which
can be used for road lane perception and autolabeling tasks. Recently,
mesh-based road surface reconstruction algorithms show promising reconstruction
results. However, these mesh-based methods suffer from slow speed and poor
rendering quality. In contrast, the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows superior
rendering speed and quality. Although 3DGS employs explicit Gaussian spheres to
represent the scene, it lacks the ability to directly represent the geometric
information of the scene. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
large-scale road surface reconstruction approach based on 2D Gaussian Splatting
(2DGS), named RoGS. The geometric shape of the road is explicitly represented
using 2D Gaussian surfels, where each surfel stores color, semantics, and
geometric information. Compared to Gaussian spheres, the Gaussian surfels
aligns more closely with the physical reality of the road. Distinct from
previous initialization methods that rely on point clouds for Gaussian spheres,
we introduce a trajectory-based initialization for Gaussian surfels. Thanks to
the explicit representation of the Gaussian surfels and a good initialization,
our method achieves a significant acceleration while improving reconstruction
quality. We achieve excellent results in reconstruction of roads surfaces in a
variety of challenging real-world scenes.

**Abstract**: In this paper, we present a low-budget and high-authenticity bidirectional
telepresence system, Tele-Aloha, targeting peer-to-peer communication
scenarios. Compared to previous systems, Tele-Aloha utilizes only four sparse
RGB cameras, one consumer-grade GPU, and one autostereoscopic screen to achieve
high-resolution (2048x2048), real-time (30 fps), low-latency (less than 150ms)
and robust distant communication. As the core of Tele-Aloha, we propose an
efficient novel view synthesis algorithm for upper-body. Firstly, we design a
cascaded disparity estimator for obtaining a robust geometry cue. Additionally
a neural rasterizer via Gaussian Splatting is introduced to project latent
features onto target view and to decode them into a reduced resolution.
Further, given the high-quality captured data, we leverage weighted blending
mechanism to refine the decoded image into the final resolution of 2K.
Exploiting world-leading autostereoscopic display and low-latency iris
tracking, users are able to experience a strong three-dimensional sense even
without any wearable head-mounted display device. Altogether, our telepresence
system demonstrates the sense of co-presence in real-life experiments,
inspiring the next generation of communication.

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) excels in photo-realistically static scenes,
inspiring numerous efforts to facilitate volumetric videos. However, rendering
dynamic and long-sequence radiance fields remains challenging due to the
significant data required to represent volumetric videos. In this paper, we
propose a novel end-to-end joint optimization scheme of dynamic NeRF
representation and compression, called JointRF, thus achieving significantly
improved quality and compression efficiency against the previous methods.
Specifically, JointRF employs a compact residual feature grid and a coefficient
feature grid to represent the dynamic NeRF. This representation handles large
motions without compromising quality while concurrently diminishing temporal
redundancy. We also introduce a sequential feature compression subnetwork to
further reduce spatial-temporal redundancy. Finally, the representation and
compression subnetworks are end-to-end trained combined within the JointRF.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that JointRF can achieve superior compression
performance across various datasets.

**Abstract**: The recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) show promising results on
the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. With its superior rendering performance
and high-fidelity rendering quality, 3DGS is excelling at its previous NeRF
counterparts. The most recent 3DGS method focuses either on improving the
instability of rendering efficiency or reducing the model size. On the other
hand, the training efficiency of 3DGS on large-scale scenes has not gained much
attention. In this work, we propose DoGaussian, a method that trains 3DGS
distributedly. Our method first decomposes a scene into K blocks and then
introduces the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) into the
training procedure of 3DGS. During training, our DoGaussian maintains one
global 3DGS model on the master node and K local 3DGS models on the slave
nodes. The K local 3DGS models are dropped after training and we only query the
global 3DGS model during inference. The training time is reduced by scene
decomposition, and the training convergence and stability are guaranteed
through the consensus on the shared 3D Gaussians. Our method accelerates the
training of 3DGS by 6+ times when evaluated on large-scale scenes while
concurrently achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality. Our project page is

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in neural rendering techniques have significantly
enhanced the fidelity of 3D reconstruction. Notably, the emergence of 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant milestone by adopting a
discrete scene representation, facilitating efficient training and real-time
rendering. Several studies have successfully extended the real-time rendering
capability of 3DGS to dynamic scenes. However, a challenge arises when training
images are captured under vastly differing weather and lighting conditions.
This scenario poses a challenge for 3DGS and its variants in achieving accurate
reconstructions. Although NeRF-based methods (NeRF-W, CLNeRF) have shown
promise in handling such challenging conditions, their computational demands
hinder real-time rendering capabilities. In this paper, we present Gaussian
Time Machine (GTM) which models the time-dependent attributes of Gaussian
primitives with discrete time embedding vectors decoded by a lightweight
Multi-Layer-Perceptron(MLP). By adjusting the opacity of Gaussian primitives,
we can reconstruct visibility changes of objects. We further propose a
decomposed color model for improved geometric consistency. GTM achieved
state-of-the-art rendering fidelity on 3 datasets and is 100 times faster than
NeRF-based counterparts in rendering. Moreover, GTM successfully disentangles
the appearance changes and renders smooth appearance interpolation.

**Abstract**: We address the estimation of the 6D pose of an unknown target spacecraft
relative to a monocular camera, a key step towards the autonomous rendezvous
and proximity operations required by future Active Debris Removal missions. We
present a novel method that enables an "off-the-shelf" spacecraft pose
estimator, which is supposed to known the target CAD model, to be applied on an
unknown target. Our method relies on an in-the wild NeRF, i.e., a Neural
Radiance Field that employs learnable appearance embeddings to represent
varying illumination conditions found in natural scenes. We train the NeRF
model using a sparse collection of images that depict the target, and in turn
generate a large dataset that is diverse both in terms of viewpoint and
illumination. This dataset is then used to train the pose estimation network.
We validate our method on the Hardware-In-the-Loop images of SPEED+ that
emulate lighting conditions close to those encountered on orbit. We demonstrate
that our method successfully enables the training of an off-the-shelf
spacecraft pose estimation network from a sparse set of images. Furthermore, we
show that a network trained using our method performs similarly to a model
trained on synthetic images generated using the CAD model of the target.

**Abstract**: Creating and customizing a 3D clothed avatar from textual descriptions is a
critical and challenging task. Traditional methods often treat the human body
and clothing as inseparable, limiting users' ability to freely mix and match
garments. In response to this limitation, we present LAyered Gaussian Avatar
(LAGA), a carefully designed framework enabling the creation of high-fidelity
decomposable avatars with diverse garments. By decoupling garments from avatar,
our framework empowers users to conviniently edit avatars at the garment level.
Our approach begins by modeling the avatar using a set of Gaussian points
organized in a layered structure, where each layer corresponds to a specific
garment or the human body itself. To generate high-quality garments for each
layer, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy for diverse garment generation
and a novel dual-SDS loss function to maintain coherence between the generated
garments and avatar components, including the human body and other garments.
Moreover, we introduce three regularization losses to guide the movement of
Gaussians for garment transfer, allowing garments to be freely transferred to
various avatars. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that our approach
surpasses existing methods in the generation of 3D clothed humans.

**Abstract**: Single-view clothed human reconstruction holds a central position in virtual
reality applications, especially in contexts involving intricate human motions.
It presents notable challenges in achieving realistic clothing deformation.
Current methodologies often overlook the influence of motion on surface
deformation, resulting in surfaces lacking the constraints imposed by global
motion. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an innovative framework,
Motion-Based 3D Clothed Humans Synthesis (MOSS), which employs kinematic
information to achieve motion-aware Gaussian split on the human surface. Our
framework consists of two modules: Kinematic Gaussian Locating Splatting (KGAS)
and Surface Deformation Detector (UID). KGAS incorporates matrix-Fisher
distribution to propagate global motion across the body surface. The density
and rotation factors of this distribution explicitly control the Gaussians,
thereby enhancing the realism of the reconstructed surface. Additionally, to
address local occlusions in single-view, based on KGAS, UID identifies
significant surfaces, and geometric reconstruction is performed to compensate
for these deformations. Experimental results demonstrate that MOSS achieves
state-of-the-art visual quality in 3D clothed human synthesis from monocular
videos. Notably, we improve the Human NeRF and the Gaussian Splatting by 33.94%
and 16.75% in LPIPS* respectively. Codes are available at

**Abstract**: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently made progress in 3D human

the geometric complexity and topological relationships of different body parts.
To address this gap, we introduce the Hierarchical Graph Human Gaussian Control
(HUGS) framework for achieving high-fidelity 3D human reconstruction. Our
approach involves leveraging explicitly semantic priors of body parts to ensure
the consistency of geometric topology, thereby enabling the capture of the
complex geometrical and topological associations among body parts.
Additionally, we disentangle high-frequency features from global human features
to refine surface details in body parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method exhibits superior performance in human body reconstruction,
particularly in enhancing surface details and accurately reconstructing body
part junctions. Codes are available at https://wanghongsheng01.github.io/HUGS/.

**Abstract**: In this work we present a novel multi-view photometric stereo (PS) method.
Like many works in 3D reconstruction we are leveraging neural shape
representations and learnt renderers. However, our work differs from the
state-of-the-art multi-view PS methods such as PS-NeRF or SuperNormal we
explicity leverage per-pixel intensity renderings rather than relying mainly on
estimated normals.
  We model point light attenuation and explicitly raytrace cast shadows in
order to best approximate each points incoming radiance. This is used as input
to a fully neural material renderer that uses minimal prior assumptions and it
is jointly optimised with the surface. Finally, estimated normal and
segmentation maps can also incorporated in order to maximise the surface
accuracy.
  Our method is among the first to outperform the classical approach of
DiLiGenT-MV and achieves average 0.2mm Chamfer distance for objects imaged at
approx 1.5m distance away with approximate 400x400 resolution. Moreover, we
show robustness to poor normals in low light count scenario, achieving 0.27mm
Chamfer distance when pixel rendering is used instead of estimated normals.

**Abstract**: The efficient representation, transmission, and reconstruction of
three-dimensional (3D) contents are becoming increasingly important for
sixth-generation (6G) networks that aim to merge virtual and physical worlds
for offering immersive communication experiences. Neural radiance field (NeRF)
and 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) have recently emerged as two promising 3D
representation techniques based on radiance field rendering, which are able to
provide photorealistic rendering results for complex scenes. Therefore,
embracing NeRF and 3D-GS in 6G networks is envisioned to be a prominent
solution to support emerging 3D applications with enhanced quality of
experience. This paper provides a comprehensive overview on the integration of
NeRF and 3D-GS in 6G. First, we review the basics of the radiance field
rendering techniques, and highlight their applications and implementation
challenges over wireless networks. Next, we consider the over-the-air training

techniques. We particularly focus on the federated learning design over a
hierarchical device-edge-cloud architecture. Then, we discuss three practical
rendering architectures of NeRF and 3D-GS models at wireless network edge. We
provide model compression approaches to facilitate the transmission of radiance
field models, and present rendering acceleration approaches and joint
computation and communication designs to enhance the rendering efficiency. In
particular, we propose a new semantic communication enabled 3D content
transmission design, in which the radiance field models are exploited as the
semantic knowledge base to reduce the communication overhead for distributed

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting showcases notable advancements in photo-realistic and
real-time novel view synthesis. However, it faces challenges in modeling mirror
reflections, which exhibit substantial appearance variations from different
viewpoints. To tackle this problem, we present MirrorGaussian, the first method
for mirror scene reconstruction with real-time rendering based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting. The key insight is grounded on the mirror symmetry between the
real-world space and the virtual mirror space. We introduce an intuitive
dual-rendering strategy that enables differentiable rasterization of both the
real-world 3D Gaussians and the mirrored counterpart obtained by reflecting the
former about the mirror plane. All 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized with the
mirror plane in an end-to-end framework. MirrorGaussian achieves high-quality
and real-time rendering in scenes with mirrors, empowering scene editing like
adding new mirrors and objects. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art results. Project page:

**Abstract**: By equipping the most recent 3D Gaussian Splatting representation with head
3D morphable models (3DMM), existing methods manage to create head avatars with
high fidelity. However, most existing methods only reconstruct a head without
the body, substantially limiting their application scenarios. We found that
naively applying Gaussians to model the clothed chest and shoulders tends to
result in blurry reconstruction and noisy floaters under novel poses. This is
because of the fundamental limitation of Gaussians and point clouds -- each
Gaussian or point can only have a single directional radiance without spatial
variance, therefore an unnecessarily large number of them is required to
represent complicated spatially varying texture, even for simple geometry. In
contrast, we propose to model the body part with a neural texture that consists
of coarse and pose-dependent fine colors. To properly render the body texture
for each view and pose without accurate geometry nor UV mapping, we optimize
another sparse set of Gaussians as anchors that constrain the neural warping
field that maps image plane coordinates to the texture space. We demonstrate
that Gaussian Head & Shoulders can fit the high-frequency details on the
clothed upper body with high fidelity and potentially improve the accuracy and
fidelity of the head region. We evaluate our method with casual phone-captured
and internet videos and show our method archives superior reconstruction
quality and robustness in both self and cross reenactment tasks. To fully
utilize the efficient rendering speed of Gaussian splatting, we additionally
propose an accelerated inference method of our trained model without
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) queries and reach a stable rendering speed of

**Abstract**: Traditional 3D garment creation is labor-intensive, involving sketching,
modeling, UV mapping, and texturing, which are time-consuming and costly.
Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have enabled new
possibilities for 3D garment generation from text prompts, images, and videos.
However, existing methods either suffer from inconsistencies among multi-view
images or require additional processes to separate cloth from the underlying
human model. In this paper, we propose GarmentDreamer, a novel method that
leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as guidance to generate wearable,
simulation-ready 3D garment meshes from text prompts. In contrast to using
multi-view images directly predicted by generative models as guidance, our 3DGS
guidance ensures consistent optimization in both garment deformation and
texture synthesis. Our method introduces a novel garment augmentation module,
guided by normal and RGBA information, and employs implicit Neural Texture
Fields (NeTF) combined with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to generate
diverse geometric and texture details. We validate the effectiveness of our
approach through comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments,
showcasing the superior performance of GarmentDreamer over state-of-the-art
alternatives. Our project page is available at:

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently advanced radiance field
reconstruction by offering superior capabilities for novel view synthesis and
real-time rendering speed. However, its strategy of blending optimization and
adaptive density control might lead to sub-optimal results; it can sometimes
yield noisy geometry and blurry artifacts due to prioritizing optimizing large
Gaussians at the cost of adequately densifying smaller ones. To address this,
we introduce AtomGS, consisting of Atomized Proliferation and Geometry-Guided
Optimization. The Atomized Proliferation constrains ellipsoid Gaussians of
various sizes into more uniform-sized Atom Gaussians. The strategy enhances the
representation of areas with fine features by placing greater emphasis on
densification in accordance with scene details. In addition, we proposed a
Geometry-Guided Optimization approach that incorporates an Edge-Aware Normal
Loss. This optimization method effectively smooths flat surfaces while
preserving intricate details. Our evaluation shows that AtomGS outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality. Additionally, it
achieves competitive accuracy in geometry reconstruction and offers a
significant improvement in training speed over other SDF-based methods. More
interactive demos can be found in our website

**Abstract**: We present MVSGaussian, a new generalizable 3D Gaussian representation
approach derived from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) that can efficiently reconstruct
unseen scenes. Specifically, 1) we leverage MVS to encode geometry-aware
Gaussian representations and decode them into Gaussian parameters. 2) To
further enhance performance, we propose a hybrid Gaussian rendering that
integrates an efficient volume rendering design for novel view synthesis. 3) To
support fast fine-tuning for specific scenes, we introduce a multi-view
geometric consistent aggregation strategy to effectively aggregate the point
clouds generated by the generalizable model, serving as the initialization for
per-scene optimization. Compared with previous generalizable NeRF-based
methods, which typically require minutes of fine-tuning and seconds of
rendering per image, MVSGaussian achieves real-time rendering with better
synthesis quality for each scene. Compared with the vanilla 3D-GS, MVSGaussian
achieves better view synthesis with less training computational cost. Extensive
experiments on DTU, Real Forward-facing, NeRF Synthetic, and Tanks and Temples
datasets validate that MVSGaussian attains state-of-the-art performance with
convincing generalizability, real-time rendering speed, and fast per-scene
optimization.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) creates a radiance field consisting of 3D
Gaussians to represent a scene. With sparse training views, 3DGS easily suffers
from overfitting, negatively impacting the reconstruction quality. This paper
introduces a new co-regularization perspective for improving sparse-view 3DGS.
When training two 3D Gaussian radiance fields with the same sparse views of a
scene, we observe that the two radiance fields exhibit \textit{point
disagreement} and \textit{rendering disagreement} that can unsupervisedly
predict reconstruction quality, stemming from the sampling implementation in
densification. We further quantify the point disagreement and rendering
disagreement by evaluating the registration between Gaussians' point
representations and calculating differences in their rendered pixels. The
empirical study demonstrates the negative correlation between the two
disagreements and accurate reconstruction, which allows us to identify
inaccurate reconstruction without accessing ground-truth information. Based on
the study, we propose CoR-GS, which identifies and suppresses inaccurate
reconstruction based on the two disagreements: (\romannumeral1) Co-pruning
considers Gaussians that exhibit high point disagreement in inaccurate
positions and prunes them. (\romannumeral2) Pseudo-view co-regularization
considers pixels that exhibit high rendering disagreement are inaccurately
rendered and suppress the disagreement. Results on LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, DTU, and
Blender demonstrate that CoR-GS effectively regularizes the scene geometry,
reconstructs the compact representations, and achieves state-of-the-art novel
view synthesis quality under sparse training views.

**Abstract**: Recently, ray tracing has gained renewed interest with the advent of
Reflective Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) technology, a key enabler of 6G wireless
communications due to its capability of intelligent manipulation of
electromagnetic waves. However, accurately modeling RIS-enabled wireless
environments poses significant challenges due to the complex variations caused
by various environmental factors and the mobility of RISs. In this paper, we
propose a novel modeling approach using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to
characterize the dynamics of electromagnetic fields in such environments. Our
method utilizes NeRF-based ray tracing to intuitively capture and visualize the
complex dynamics of signal propagation, effectively modeling the complete
signal pathways from the transmitter to the RIS, and from the RIS to the
receiver. This two-stage process accurately characterizes multiple complex
transmission paths, enhancing our understanding of signal behavior in
real-world scenarios. Our approach predicts the signal field for any specified
RIS placement and receiver location, facilitating efficient RIS deployment.
Experimental evaluations using both simulated and real-world data validate the
significant benefits of our methodology.

**Abstract**: Numerous studies on adversarial attacks targeting self-driving policies fail
to incorporate realistic-looking adversarial objects, limiting real-world
applicability. Building upon prior research that facilitated the transition of
adversarial objects from simulations to practical applications, this paper
discusses a modified gradient-based texture optimization method to discover
realistic-looking adversarial objects. While retaining the core architecture
and techniques of the prior research, the proposed addition involves an entity
termed the 'Judge'. This agent assesses the texture of a rendered object,
assigning a probability score reflecting its realism. This score is integrated
into the loss function to encourage the NeRF object renderer to concurrently
learn realistic and adversarial textures. The paper analyzes four strategies
for developing a robust 'Judge': 1) Leveraging cutting-edge vision-language
models. 2) Fine-tuning open-sourced vision-language models. 3) Pretraining
neurosymbolic systems. 4) Utilizing traditional image processing techniques.
Our findings indicate that strategies 1) and 4) yield less reliable outcomes,
pointing towards strategies 2) or 3) as more promising directions for future
research.

**Abstract**: In this work, we propose a novel Trajectory Score Matching (TSM) method that
aims to solve the pseudo ground truth inconsistency problem caused by the
accumulated error in Interval Score Matching (ISM) when using the Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion process. Unlike ISM which adopts the
inversion process of DDIM to calculate on a single path, our TSM method
leverages the inversion process of DDIM to generate two paths from the same
starting point for calculation. Since both paths start from the same starting
point, TSM can reduce the accumulated error compared to ISM, thus alleviating
the problem of pseudo ground truth inconsistency. TSM enhances the stability
and consistency of the model's generated paths during the distillation process.
We demonstrate this experimentally and further show that ISM is a special case
of TSM. Furthermore, to optimize the current multi-stage optimization process
from high-resolution text to 3D generation, we adopt Stable Diffusion XL for
guidance. In response to the issues of abnormal replication and splitting
caused by unstable gradients during the 3D Gaussian splatting process when
using Stable Diffusion XL, we propose a pixel-by-pixel gradient clipping
method. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly surpasses the
state-of-the-art models in terms of visual quality and performance. Code:

**Abstract**: With their high-fidelity scene representation capability, the attention of
SLAM field is deeply attracted by the Neural Radiation Field (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Recently, there has been a Surge in NeRF-based SLAM,
while 3DGS-based SLAM is sparse. A novel 3DGS-based SLAM approach with a fusion
of deep visual feature, dual keyframe selection and 3DGS is presented in this
paper. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed selectively tracking is
achieved by feature extraction and motion filter on each frame. The joint
optimization of pose and 3D Gaussian runs through the entire mapping process.
Additionally, the coarse-to-fine pose estimation and compact Gaussian scene
representation are implemented by dual keyfeature selection and novel loss
functions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not
only outperforms the existing methods in tracking and mapping, but also has
less memory usage.

retrieved the 3D geometry of the scene using the 3D point cloud extracted from
the 3D Gaussian Splatting model which we benchmarked against our Multi-

Additionally, we propose a depth consistency module to enhance 3D scene

Gaussian splats. Experimental results demonstrate ART3D's superior performance
in both content and structural consistency metrics when compared to existing
methods. ART3D significantly advances the field of AI in art creation by
providing an innovative solution for generating high-quality 3D artistic

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) evolve, their integration with 3D spatial
data (3D-LLMs) has seen rapid progress, offering unprecedented capabilities for
understanding and interacting with physical spaces. This survey provides a
comprehensive overview of the methodologies enabling LLMs to process,
understand, and generate 3D data. Highlighting the unique advantages of LLMs,

significantly advance spatial comprehension and interaction within embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. Our investigation spans various 3D data
representations, from point clouds to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). It
examines their integration with LLMs for tasks such as 3D scene understanding,
captioning, question-answering, and dialogue, as well as LLM-based agents for
spatial reasoning, planning, and navigation. The paper also includes a brief
review of other methods that integrate 3D and language. The meta-analysis
presented in this paper reveals significant progress yet underscores the
necessity for novel approaches to harness the full potential of 3D-LLMs. Hence,
with this paper, we aim to chart a course for future research that explores and
expands the capabilities of 3D-LLMs in understanding and interacting with the

**Abstract**: Active reconstruction technique enables robots to autonomously collect scene
data for full coverage, relieving users from tedious and time-consuming data
capturing process. However, designed based on unsuitable scene representations,
existing methods show unrealistic reconstruction results or the inability of
online quality evaluation. Due to the recent advancements in explicit radiance
field technology, online active high-fidelity reconstruction has become
achievable. In this paper, we propose GS-Planner, a planning framework for
active high-fidelity reconstruction using 3D Gaussian Splatting. With
improvement on 3DGS to recognize unobserved regions, we evaluate the
reconstruction quality and completeness of 3DGS map online to guide the robot.
Then we design a sampling-based active reconstruction strategy to explore the
unobserved areas and improve the reconstruction geometric and textural quality.
To establish a complete robot active reconstruction system, we choose quadrotor
as the robotic platform for its high agility. Then we devise a safety
constraint with 3DGS to generate executable trajectories for quadrotor
navigation in the 3DGS map. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we
conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies in highly realistic
simulation scenes.

**Abstract**: For robotics applications where there is a limited number of (typically
ego-centric) views, parametric representations such as neural radiance fields
(NeRFs) generalize better than non-parametric ones such as Gaussian splatting
(GS) to views that are very different from those in the training data; GS
however can render much faster than NeRFs. We develop a procedure to convert
back and forth between the two. Our approach achieves the best of both NeRFs
(superior PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS on dissimilar views, and a compact
representation) and GS (real-time rendering and ability for easily modifying
the representation); the computational cost of these conversions is minor
compared to training the two from scratch.

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Field(NeRF) is an novel implicit method to achieve the 3D
reconstruction and representation with a high resolution. After the first
research of NeRF is proposed, NeRF has gained a robust developing power and is
booming in the 3D modeling, representation and reconstruction areas. However
the first and most of the followed research projects based on NeRF is static,
which are weak in the practical applications. Therefore, more researcher are
interested and focused on the study of dynamic NeRF that is more feasible and
useful in practical applications or situations. Compared with the static NeRF,
implementing the Dynamic NeRF is more difficult and complex. But Dynamic is
more potential in the future even is the basic of Editable NeRF. In this
review, we made a detailed and abundant statement for the development and
important implementation principles of Dynamci NeRF. The analysis of main
principle and development of Dynamic NeRF is from 2021 to 2023, including the
most of the Dynamic NeRF projects. What is more, with colorful and novel
special designed figures and table, We also made a detailed comparison and
analysis of different features of various of Dynamic. Besides, we analyzed and
discussed the key methods to implement a Dynamic NeRF. The volume of the
reference papers is large. The statements and comparisons are multidimensional.
With a reading of this review, the whole development history and most of the

**Abstract**: The multi-plane representation has been highlighted for its fast training and
inference across static and dynamic neural radiance fields. This approach
constructs relevant features via projection onto learnable grids and
interpolating adjacent vertices. However, it has limitations in capturing
low-frequency details and tends to overuse parameters for low-frequency
features due to its bias toward fine details, despite its multi-resolution
concept. This phenomenon leads to instability and inefficiency when training
poses are sparse. In this work, we propose a method that synergistically
integrates multi-plane representation with a coordinate-based network known for
strong bias toward low-frequency signals. The coordinate-based network is
responsible for capturing low-frequency details, while the multi-plane
representation focuses on capturing fine-grained details. We demonstrate that
using residual connections between them seamlessly preserves their own inherent
properties. Additionally, the proposed progressive training scheme accelerates
the disentanglement of these two features. We empirically show that the
proposed method achieves comparable results to explicit encoding with fewer
parameters, and particularly, it outperforms others for the static and dynamic
NeRFs under sparse inputs.

**Abstract**: The increasing prominence of e-commerce has underscored the importance of
Virtual Try-On (VTON). However, previous studies predominantly focus on the 2D
realm and rely heavily on extensive data for training. Research on 3D VTON
primarily centers on garment-body shape compatibility, a topic extensively

work, we propose GaussianVTON, an innovative 3D VTON pipeline integrating
Gaussian Splatting (GS) editing with 2D VTON. To facilitate a seamless
transition from 2D to 3D VTON, we propose, for the first time, the use of only
images as editing prompts for 3D editing. To further address issues, e.g., face
blurring, garment inaccuracy, and degraded viewpoint quality during editing, we
devise a three-stage refinement strategy to gradually mitigate potential
issues. Furthermore, we introduce a new editing strategy termed Edit Recall
Reconstruction (ERR) to tackle the limitations of previous editing strategies
in leading to complex geometric changes. Our comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of GaussianVTON, offering a novel perspective on 3D
VTON while also establishing a novel starting point for image-prompting 3D

**Abstract**: In NeRF-aided editing tasks, object movement presents difficulties in
supervision generation due to the introduction of variability in object
positions. Moreover, the removal operations of certain scene objects often lead
to empty regions, presenting challenges for NeRF models in inpainting them
effectively. We propose an implicit ray transformation strategy, allowing for
direct manipulation of the 3D object's pose by operating on the neural-point in
NeRF rays. To address the challenge of inpainting potential empty regions, we
present a plug-and-play inpainting module, dubbed differentiable neural-point
resampling (DNR), which interpolates those regions in 3D space at the original
ray locations within the implicit space, thereby facilitating object removal &
scene inpainting tasks. Importantly, employing DNR effectively narrows the gap
between ground truth and predicted implicit features, potentially increasing
the mutual information (MI) of the features across rays. Then, we leverage DNR
and ray transformation to construct a point-based editable NeRF pipeline
PR^2T-NeRF. Results primarily evaluated on 3D object removal & inpainting tasks
indicate that our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance. In addition,
our pipeline supports high-quality rendering visualization for diverse editing
operations without necessitating extra supervision.

**Abstract**: Accurately reconstructing a 3D scene including explicit geometry information
is both attractive and challenging. Geometry reconstruction can benefit from
incorporating differentiable appearance models, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). In this work, we propose a learnable scene
model that incorporates 3DGS with an explicit geometry representation, namely a
mesh. Our model learns the mesh and appearance in an end-to-end manner, where
we bind 3D Gaussians to the mesh faces and perform differentiable rendering of
3DGS to obtain photometric supervision. The model creates an effective
information pathway to supervise the learning of the scene, including the mesh.
Experimental results demonstrate that the learned scene model not only achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality but also supports manipulation using the
explicit mesh. In addition, our model has a unique advantage in adapting to
scene updates, thanks to the end-to-end learning of both mesh and appearance.

**Abstract**: The reliance on accurate camera poses is a significant barrier to the
widespread deployment of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) models for 3D
reconstruction and SLAM tasks. The existing method introduces monocular depth
priors to jointly optimize the camera poses and NeRF, which fails to fully
exploit the depth priors and neglects the impact of their inherent noise. In
this paper, we propose Truncated Depth NeRF (TD-NeRF), a novel approach that
enables training NeRF from unknown camera poses - by jointly optimizing
learnable parameters of the radiance field and camera poses. Our approach
explicitly utilizes monocular depth priors through three key advancements: 1)
we propose a novel depth-based ray sampling strategy based on the truncated
normal distribution, which improves the convergence speed and accuracy of pose
estimation; 2) to circumvent local minima and refine depth geometry, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine training strategy that progressively improves the
depth precision; 3) we propose a more robust inter-frame point constraint that
enhances robustness against depth noise during training. The experimental
results on three datasets demonstrate that TD-NeRF achieves superior
performance in the joint optimization of camera pose and NeRF, surpassing prior
works, and generates more accurate depth geometry. The implementation of our
method has been released at https://github.com/nubot-nudt/TD-NeRF.

**Abstract**: This letter introduces a novel framework for dense Visual Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) based on Gaussian Splatting. Recently Gaussian
Splatting-based SLAM has yielded promising results, but rely on RGB-D input and
is weak in tracking. To address these limitations, we uniquely integrates
advanced sparse visual odometry with a dense Gaussian Splatting scene
representation for the first time, thereby eliminating the dependency on depth
maps typical of Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM systems and enhancing tracking
robustness. Here, the sparse visual odometry tracks camera poses in RGB stream,
while Gaussian Splatting handles map reconstruction. These components are
interconnected through a Multi-View Stereo (MVS) depth estimation network. And
we propose a depth smooth loss to reduce the negative effect of estimated depth
maps. Furthermore, the consistency in scale between the sparse visual odometry
and the dense Gaussian map is preserved by Sparse-Dense Adjustment Ring (SDAR).
We have evaluated our system across various synthetic and real-world datasets.
The accuracy of our pose estimation surpasses existing methods and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, it outperforms previous monocular
methods in terms of novel view synthesis fidelity, matching the results of
neural SLAM systems that utilize RGB-D input.

**Abstract**: Transparent objects are ubiquitous in industry, pharmaceuticals, and
households. Grasping and manipulating these objects is a significant challenge
for robots. Existing methods have difficulty reconstructing complete depth maps
for challenging transparent objects, leaving holes in the depth reconstruction.
Recent work has shown neural radiance fields (NeRFs) work well for depth
perception in scenes with transparent objects, and these depth maps can be used
to grasp transparent objects with high accuracy. NeRF-based depth
reconstruction can still struggle with especially challenging transparent
objects and lighting conditions. In this work, we propose Residual-NeRF, a
method to improve depth perception and training speed for transparent objects.
Robots often operate in the same area, such as a kitchen. By first learning a
background NeRF of the scene without transparent objects to be manipulated, we
reduce the ambiguity faced by learning the changes with the new object. We
propose training two additional networks: a residual NeRF learns to infer
residual RGB values and densities, and a Mixnet learns how to combine
background and residual NeRFs. We contribute synthetic and real experiments
that suggest Residual-NeRF improves depth perception of transparent objects.
The results on synthetic data suggest Residual-NeRF outperforms the baselines
with a 46.1% lower RMSE and a 29.5% lower MAE. Real-world qualitative
experiments suggest Residual-NeRF leads to more robust depth maps with less
noise and fewer holes. Website: https://residual-nerf.github.io

**Abstract**: LaTex coding is one of the main methods of writing an academic paper. When
writing a paper, abundant proper visual or graphic components will represent
more information volume than the textual data. However, most of the
implementation of LaTex graphic items are designed as static items that have
some weaknesses in representing more informative figures or tables with an
interactive reading experience. To address this problem, we propose LIVE, a
novel design methods idea to design interactive LaTex graphic items. To make a
lucid representation of the main idea of LIVE, we designed several novels
representing implementations that are interactive and enough explanation for
the basic level principles. Using LIVE can design more graphic items, which we
call the Gitems, and easily and automatically get the relationship of the
mutual application of a specific range of papers, which will add more vitality
and performance factors into writing of traditional papers especially the
review papers. For vividly representing the functions of LIVE, we use the
papers from NeRF as the example reference papers. The code of the
implementation project is open source.

## Aerial-NeRF: Adaptive Spatial Partitioning and Sampling for Large-Scale  Aerial Rendering

**Abstract**: Recent progress in large-scale scene rendering has yielded Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF)-based models with an impressive ability to synthesize scenes
across small objects and indoor scenes. Nevertheless, extending this idea to
large-scale aerial rendering poses two critical problems. Firstly, a single
NeRF cannot render the entire scene with high-precision for complex large-scale
aerial datasets since the sampling range along each view ray is insufficient to
cover buildings adequately. Secondly, traditional NeRFs are infeasible to train
on one GPU to enable interactive fly-throughs for modeling massive images.
Instead, existing methods typically separate the whole scene into multiple
regions and train a NeRF on each region, which are unaccustomed to different
flight trajectories and difficult to achieve fast rendering. To that end, we
propose Aerial-NeRF with three innovative modifications for jointly adapting
NeRF in large-scale aerial rendering: (1) Designing an adaptive spatial
partitioning and selection method based on drones' poses to adapt different
flight trajectories; (2) Using similarity of poses instead of (expert) network
for rendering speedup to determine which region a new viewpoint belongs to; (3)
Developing an adaptive sampling approach for rendering performance improvement
to cover the entire buildings at different heights. Extensive experiments have
conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of Aerial-NeRF, and new
state-of-the-art results have been achieved on two public large-scale aerial
datasets and presented SCUTic dataset. Note that our model allows us to perform
rendering over 4 times as fast as compared to multiple competitors. Our
dataset, code, and model are publicly available at https://drliuqi.github.io/.

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting is a novel method for 3D view synthesis, which can gain
an implicit neural learning rendering result than the traditional neural
rendering technology but keep the more high-definition fast rendering speed.
But it is still difficult to achieve a fast enough efficiency on 3D Gaussian
Splatting for the practical applications. To Address this issue, we propose the
I3DS, a synthetic model performance improvement evaluation solution and
experiments test. From multiple and important levels or dimensions of the
original 3D Gaussian Splatting, we made more than two thousand various kinds of
experiments to test how the selected different items and components can make an
impact on the training efficiency of the 3D Gaussian Splatting model. In this
paper, we will share abundant and meaningful experiences and methods about how
to improve the training, performance and the impacts caused by different items
of the model. A special but normal Integer compression in base 95 and a
floating-point compression in base 94 with ASCII encoding and decoding
mechanism is presented. Many real and effective experiments and test results or
phenomena will be recorded. After a series of reasonable fine-tuning, I3DS can
gain excellent performance improvements than the previous one. The project code

**Abstract**: One image to editable dynamic 3D model and video generation is novel
direction and change in the research area of single image to 3D representation
or 3D reconstruction of image. Gaussian Splatting has demonstrated its
advantages in implicit 3D reconstruction, compared with the original Neural
Radiance Fields. As the rapid development of technologies and principles,
people tried to used the Stable Diffusion models to generate targeted models
with text instructions. However, using the normal implicit machine learning
methods is hard to gain the precise motions and actions control, further more,
it is difficult to generate a long content and semantic continuous 3D video. To
address this issue, we propose the OneTo3D, a method and theory to used one
single image to generate the editable 3D model and generate the targeted
semantic continuous time-unlimited 3D video. We used a normal basic Gaussian
Splatting model to generate the 3D model from a single image, which requires
less volume of video memory and computer calculation ability. Subsequently, we
designed an automatic generation and self-adaptive binding mechanism for the
object armature. Combined with the re-editable motions and actions analyzing
and controlling algorithm we proposed, we can achieve a better performance than
the SOTA projects in the area of building the 3D model precise motions and
actions control, and generating a stable semantic continuous time-unlimited 3D
video with the input text instructions. Here we will analyze the detailed
implementation methods and theories analyses. Relative comparisons and
conclusions will be presented. The project code is open source.

## SketchDream: Sketch-based Text-to-3D Generation and Editing

**Abstract**: Existing text-based 3D generation methods generate attractive results but
lack detailed geometry control. Sketches, known for their conciseness and
expressiveness, have contributed to intuitive 3D modeling but are confined to
producing texture-less mesh models within predefined categories. Integrating
sketch and text simultaneously for 3D generation promises enhanced control over
geometry and appearance but faces challenges from 2D-to-3D translation
ambiguity and multi-modal condition integration. Moreover, further editing of
3D models in arbitrary views will give users more freedom to customize their
models. However, it is difficult to achieve high generation quality, preserve
unedited regions, and manage proper interactions between shape components. To
solve the above issues, we propose a text-driven 3D content generation and
editing method, SketchDream, which supports NeRF generation from given
hand-drawn sketches and achieves free-view sketch-based local editing. To
tackle the 2D-to-3D ambiguity challenge, we introduce a sketch-based multi-view
image generation diffusion model, which leverages depth guidance to establish
spatial correspondence. A 3D ControlNet with a 3D attention module is utilized
to control multi-view images and ensure their 3D consistency. To support local
editing, we further propose a coarse-to-fine editing approach: the coarse phase
analyzes component interactions and provides 3D masks to label edited regions,
while the fine stage generates realistic results with refined details by local
enhancement. Extensive experiments validate that our method generates
higher-quality results compared with a combination of 2D ControlNet and
image-to-3D generation techniques and achieves detailed control compared with
existing diffusion-based 3D editing approaches.

**Abstract**: Audio-driven talking head generation is advancing from 2D to 3D content.
Notably, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is in the spotlight as a means to
synthesize high-quality 3D talking head outputs. Unfortunately, this NeRF-based
approach typically requires a large number of paired audio-visual data for each
identity, thereby limiting the scalability of the method. Although there have
been attempts to generate audio-driven 3D talking head animations with a single
image, the results are often unsatisfactory due to insufficient information on
obscured regions in the image. In this paper, we mainly focus on addressing the
overlooked aspect of 3D consistency in the one-shot, audio-driven domain, where
facial animations are synthesized primarily in front-facing perspectives. We
propose a novel method, NeRFFaceSpeech, which enables to produce high-quality
3D-aware talking head. Using prior knowledge of generative models combined with
NeRF, our method can craft a 3D-consistent facial feature space corresponding
to a single image. Our spatial synchronization method employs audio-correlated
vertex dynamics of a parametric face model to transform static image features
into dynamic visuals through ray deformation, ensuring realistic 3D facial
motion. Moreover, we introduce LipaintNet that can replenish the lacking
information in the inner-mouth area, which can not be obtained from a given
single image. The network is trained in a self-supervised manner by utilizing
the generative capabilities without additional data. The comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in generating
audio-driven talking heads from a single image with enhanced 3D consistency
compared to previous approaches. In addition, we introduce a quantitative way
of measuring the robustness of a model against pose changes for the first time,
which has been possible only qualitatively.

**Abstract**: User-friendly 3D object editing is a challenging task that has attracted
significant attention recently. The limitations of direct 3D object editing
without 2D prior knowledge have prompted increased attention towards utilizing
2D generative models for 3D editing. While existing methods like Instruct
NeRF-to-NeRF offer a solution, they often lack user-friendliness, particularly
due to semantic guided editing. In the realm of 3D representation, 3D Gaussian
Splatting emerges as a promising approach for its efficiency and natural
explicit property, facilitating precise editing tasks. Building upon these
insights, we propose DragGaussian, a 3D object drag-editing framework based on
3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging diffusion models for interactive image
editing with open-vocabulary input. This framework enables users to perform
drag-based editing on pre-trained 3D Gaussian object models, producing modified
2D images through multi-view consistent editing. Our contributions include the
introduction of a new task, the development of DragGaussian for interactive
point-based 3D editing, and comprehensive validation of its effectiveness
through qualitative and quantitative experiments.

**Abstract**: Gaussian Splatting has garnered widespread attention due to its exceptional
performance. Consequently, SLAM systems based on Gaussian Splatting have
emerged, leveraging its capabilities for rapid real-time rendering and
high-fidelity mapping. However, current Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems usually
struggle with large scene representation and lack effective loop closure
adjustments and scene generalization capabilities. To address these issues, we
introduce NGM-SLAM, the first GS-SLAM system that utilizes neural radiance
field submaps for progressive scene expression, effectively integrating the
strengths of neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting. We have
developed neural implicit submaps as supervision and achieve high-quality scene
expression and online loop closure adjustments through Gaussian rendering of
fused submaps. Our results on multiple real-world scenes and large-scale scene
datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate gap filling and
high-quality scene expression, supporting both monocular, stereo, and RGB-D
inputs, and achieving state-of-the-art scene reconstruction and tracking

**Abstract**: Text-driven 3D indoor scene generation holds broad applications, ranging from
gaming and smart homes to AR/VR applications. Fast and high-fidelity scene
generation is paramount for ensuring user-friendly experiences. However,
existing methods are characterized by lengthy generation processes or
necessitate the intricate manual specification of motion parameters, which
introduces inconvenience for users. Furthermore, these methods often rely on
narrow-field viewpoint iterative generations, compromising global consistency
and overall scene quality. To address these issues, we propose FastScene, a
framework for fast and higher-quality 3D scene generation, while maintaining
the scene consistency. Specifically, given a text prompt, we generate a
panorama and estimate its depth, since the panorama encompasses information
about the entire scene and exhibits explicit geometric constraints. To obtain
high-quality novel views, we introduce the Coarse View Synthesis (CVS) and
Progressive Novel View Inpainting (PNVI) strategies, ensuring both scene
consistency and view quality. Subsequently, we utilize Multi-View Projection
(MVP) to form perspective views, and apply 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for
scene reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate FastScene surpasses
other methods in both generation speed and quality with better scene
consistency. Notably, guided only by a text prompt, FastScene can generate a 3D
scene within a mere 15 minutes, which is at least one hour faster than
state-of-the-art methods, making it a paradigm for user-friendly scene
generation.

NeRF holds immense promise for improving performance. In this paper, we present
a comprehensive survey and analysis of the state-of-the-art techniques for

focus on the perception, localization and navigation, and decision-making
modules of autonomous robots and delve into tasks crucial for autonomous
operation, including 3D reconstruction, segmentation, pose estimation,
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), navigation and planning, and
interaction. Our survey meticulously benchmarks existing NeRF-based methods,
providing insights into their strengths and limitations. Moreover, we explore
promising avenues for future research and development in this domain. Notably,
we discuss the integration of advanced techniques such as 3D Gaussian splatting
(3DGS), large language models (LLM), and generative AIs, envisioning enhanced
reconstruction efficiency, scene understanding, decision-making capabilities.
This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to leverage NeRFs to

**Abstract**: Point-based representations have recently gained popularity in novel view
synthesis, for their unique advantages, e.g., intuitive geometric
representation, simple manipulation, and faster convergence. However, based on
our observation, these point-based neural re-rendering methods are only
expected to perform well under ideal conditions and suffer from noisy, patchy
points and unbounded scenes, which are challenging to handle but defacto common
in real applications. To this end, we revisit one such influential method,
known as Neural Point-based Graphics (NPBG), as our baseline, and propose
Robust Point-based Graphics (RPBG). We in-depth analyze the factors that
prevent NPBG from achieving satisfactory renderings on generic datasets, and
accordingly reform the pipeline to make it more robust to varying datasets
in-the-wild. Inspired by the practices in image restoration, we greatly enhance
the neural renderer to enable the attention-based correction of point
visibility and the inpainting of incomplete rasterization, with only acceptable
overheads. We also seek for a simple and lightweight alternative for
environment modeling and an iterative method to alleviate the problem of poor
geometry. By thorough evaluation on a wide range of datasets with different
shooting conditions and camera trajectories, RPBG stably outperforms the
baseline by a large margin, and exhibits its great robustness over
state-of-the-art NeRF-based variants. Code available at

**Abstract**: The 3D Gaussian splatting methods are getting popular. However, they work
directly on the signal, leading to a dense representation of the signal. Even
with some techniques such as pruning or distillation, the results are still
dense. In this paper, we propose to model the gradient of the original signal.
The gradients are much sparser than the original signal. Therefore, the
gradients use much less Gaussian splats, leading to the more efficient storage
and thus higher computational performance during both training and rendering.
Thanks to the sparsity, during the view synthesis, only a small mount of pixels
are needed, leading to much higher computational performance ($100\sim
1000\times$ faster). And the 2D image can be recovered from the gradients via
solving a Poisson equation with linear computation complexity. Several
experiments are performed to confirm the sparseness of the gradients and the
computation performance of the proposed method. The method can be applied
various applications, such as human body modeling and indoor environment
modeling.

**Abstract**: Neural fields (NeRF) have emerged as a promising approach for representing
continuous 3D scenes. Nevertheless, the lack of semantic encoding in NeRFs
poses a significant challenge for scene decomposition. To address this
challenge, we present a single model, Multi-Modal Decomposition NeRF
(${M^2D}$NeRF), that is capable of both text-based and visual patch-based
edits. Specifically, we use multi-modal feature distillation to integrate
teacher features from pretrained visual and language models into 3D semantic
feature volumes, thereby facilitating consistent 3D editing. To enforce
consistency between the visual and language features in our 3D feature volumes,
we introduce a multi-modal similarity constraint. We also introduce a
patch-based joint contrastive loss that helps to encourage object-regions to
coalesce in the 3D feature space, resulting in more precise boundaries.
Experiments on various real-world scenes show superior performance in 3D scene
decomposition tasks compared to prior NeRF-based methods.

**Abstract**: We present Splat-MOVER, a modular robotics stack for open-vocabulary robotic
manipulation, which leverages the editability of Gaussian Splatting (GSplat)
scene representations to enable multi-stage manipulation tasks. Splat-MOVER
consists of: (i) ASK-Splat, a GSplat representation that distills latent codes
for language semantics and grasp affordance into the 3D scene. ASK-Splat
enables geometric, semantic, and affordance understanding of 3D scenes, which
is critical for many robotics tasks; (ii) SEE-Splat, a real-time scene-editing
module using 3D semantic masking and infilling to visualize the motions of
objects that result from robot interactions in the real-world. SEE-Splat
creates a "digital twin" of the evolving environment throughout the
manipulation task; and (iii) Grasp-Splat, a grasp generation module that uses
ASK-Splat and SEE-Splat to propose candidate grasps for open-world objects.
ASK-Splat is trained in real-time from RGB images in a brief scanning phase
prior to operation, while SEE-Splat and Grasp-Splat run in real-time during
operation. We demonstrate the superior performance of Splat-MOVER in hardware
experiments on a Kinova robot compared to two recent baselines in four
single-stage, open-vocabulary manipulation tasks, as well as in four
multi-stage manipulation tasks using the edited scene to reflect scene changes
due to prior manipulation stages, which is not possible with the existing
baselines. Code for this project and a link to the project page will be made

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have become a rapidly growing research field
with the potential to revolutionize typical photogrammetric workflows, such as
those used for 3D scene reconstruction. As input, NeRFs require multi-view
images with corresponding camera poses as well as the interior orientation. In
the typical NeRF workflow, the camera poses and the interior orientation are
estimated in advance with Structure from Motion (SfM). But the quality of the
resulting novel views, which depends on different parameters such as the number
and distribution of available images, as well as the accuracy of the related
camera poses and interior orientation, is difficult to predict. In addition,
SfM is a time-consuming pre-processing step, and its quality strongly depends
on the image content. Furthermore, the undefined scaling factor of SfM hinders
subsequent steps in which metric information is required. In this paper, we
evaluate the potential of NeRFs for industrial robot applications. We propose
an alternative to SfM pre-processing: we capture the input images with a
calibrated camera that is attached to the end effector of an industrial robot
and determine accurate camera poses with metric scale based on the robot
kinematics. We then investigate the quality of the novel views by comparing
them to ground truth, and by computing an internal quality measure based on
ensemble methods. For evaluation purposes, we acquire multiple datasets that
pose challenges for reconstruction typical of industrial applications, like
reflective objects, poor texture, and fine structures. We show that the
robot-based pose determination reaches similar accuracy as SfM in non-demanding
cases, while having clear advantages in more challenging scenarios. Finally, we
present first results of applying the ensemble method to estimate the quality
of the synthetic novel view in the absence of a ground truth.

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Field~(NeRF) achieves extremely high quality in object-scaled
and indoor scene reconstruction. However, there exist some challenges when
reconstructing large-scale scenes. MLP-based NeRFs suffer from limited network
capacity, while volume-based NeRFs are heavily memory-consuming when the scene
resolution increases. Recent approaches propose to geographically partition the
scene and learn each sub-region using an individual NeRF. Such partitioning
strategies help volume-based NeRF exceed the single GPU memory limit and scale
to larger scenes. However, this approach requires multiple background NeRF to
handle out-of-partition rays, which leads to redundancy of learning. Inspired
by the fact that the background of current partition is the foreground of
adjacent partition, we propose a scalable scene reconstruction method based on
joint Multi-resolution Hash Grids, named DistGrid. In this method, the scene is
divided into multiple closely-paved yet non-overlapped Axis-Aligned Bounding
Boxes, and a novel segmented volume rendering method is proposed to handle
cross-boundary rays, thereby eliminating the need for background NeRFs. The
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods on all
evaluated large-scale scenes, and provides visually plausible scene
reconstruction. The scalability of our method on reconstruction quality is
further evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively.

**Abstract**: Novel view synthesis from a sparse set of input images is a challenging
problem of great practical interest, especially when camera poses are absent or
inaccurate. Direct optimization of camera poses and usage of estimated depths
in neural radiance field algorithms usually do not produce good results because
of the coupling between poses and depths, and inaccuracies in monocular depth
estimation. In this paper, we leverage the recent 3D Gaussian splatting method
to develop a novel construct-and-optimize method for sparse view synthesis
without camera poses. Specifically, we construct a solution progressively by
using monocular depth and projecting pixels back into the 3D world. During
construction, we optimize the solution by detecting 2D correspondences between
training views and the corresponding rendered images. We develop a unified
differentiable pipeline for camera registration and adjustment of both camera
poses and depths, followed by back-projection. We also introduce a novel notion
of an expected surface in Gaussian splatting, which is critical to our
optimization. These steps enable a coarse solution, which can then be low-pass
filtered and refined using standard optimization methods. We demonstrate
results on the Tanks and Temples and Static Hikes datasets with as few as three
widely-spaced views, showing significantly better quality than competing
methods, including those with approximate camera pose information. Moreover,
our results improve with more views and outperform previous InstantNGP and
Gaussian Splatting algorithms even when using half the dataset.

## MVIP-NeRF: Multi-view 3D Inpainting on NeRF Scenes via Diffusion Prior

**Abstract**: Despite the emergence of successful NeRF inpainting methods built upon
explicit RGB and depth 2D inpainting supervisions, these methods are inherently
constrained by the capabilities of their underlying 2D inpainters. This is due
to two key reasons: (i) independently inpainting constituent images results in
view-inconsistent imagery, and (ii) 2D inpainters struggle to ensure
high-quality geometry completion and alignment with inpainted RGB images.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach called MVIP-NeRF
that harnesses the potential of diffusion priors for NeRF inpainting,
addressing both appearance and geometry aspects. MVIP-NeRF performs joint
inpainting across multiple views to reach a consistent solution, which is
achieved via an iterative optimization process based on Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS). Apart from recovering the rendered RGB images, we also extract
normal maps as a geometric representation and define a normal SDS loss that
motivates accurate geometry inpainting and alignment with the appearance.
Additionally, we formulate a multi-view SDS score function to distill
generative priors simultaneously from different view images, ensuring
consistent visual completion when dealing with large view variations. Our
experimental results show better appearance and geometry recovery than previous
NeRF inpainting methods.

**Abstract**: Due to the limited model capacity, leveraging distributed Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRFs) for modeling extensive urban environments has become a
necessity. However, current distributed NeRF registration approaches encounter
aliasing artifacts, arising from discrepancies in rendering resolutions and
suboptimal pose precision. These factors collectively deteriorate the fidelity
of pose estimation within NeRF frameworks, resulting in occlusion artifacts
during the NeRF blending stage. In this paper, we present a distributed NeRF
system with tri-stage pose optimization. In the first stage, precise poses of
images are achieved by bundle adjusting Mip-NeRF 360 with a coarse-to-fine
strategy. In the second stage, we incorporate the inverting Mip-NeRF 360,
coupled with the truncated dynamic low-pass filter, to enable the achievement
of robust and precise poses, termed Frame2Model optimization. On top of this,
we obtain a coarse transformation between NeRFs in different coordinate
systems. In the third stage, we fine-tune the transformation between NeRFs by
Model2Model pose optimization. After obtaining precise transformation
parameters, we proceed to implement NeRF blending, showcasing superior
performance metrics in both real-world and simulation scenarios. Codes and data
will be publicly available at https://github.com/boilcy/Distributed-NeRF.

**Abstract**: In this paper, we present a new approach to bridge the domain gap between
synthetic and real-world data for un- manned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based
perception. Our formu- lation is designed for dynamic scenes, consisting of
moving objects or human actions, where the goal is to recognize the pose or
actions. We propose an extension of K-Planes Neural Radiance Field (NeRF),
wherein our algorithm stores a set of tiered feature vectors. The tiered
feature vectors are generated to effectively model conceptual information about
a scene as well as an image decoder that transforms output feature maps into
RGB images. Our technique leverages the information amongst both static and
dynamic objects within a scene and is able to capture salient scene attributes
of high altitude videos. We evaluate its performance on challenging datasets,
including Okutama Action and UG2, and observe considerable improvement in
accuracy over state of the art aerial perception algorithms.

**Abstract**: Active learning in 3D scene reconstruction has been widely studied, as
selecting informative training views is critical for the reconstruction.
Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) variants have shown performance
increases in active 3D reconstruction using image rendering or geometric
uncertainty. However, the simultaneous consideration of both uncertainties in
selecting informative views remains unexplored, while utilizing different types
of uncertainty can reduce the bias that arises in the early training stage with
sparse inputs. In this paper, we propose ActiveNeuS, which evaluates candidate
views considering both uncertainties. ActiveNeuS provides a way to accumulate
image rendering uncertainty while avoiding the bias that the estimated
densities can introduce. ActiveNeuS computes the neural implicit surface
uncertainty, providing the color uncertainty along with the surface
information. It efficiently handles the bias by using the surface information
and a grid, enabling the fast selection of diverse viewpoints. Our method
outperforms previous works on popular datasets, Blender and DTU, showing that
the views selected by ActiveNeuS significantly improve performance.

**Abstract**: Despite significant advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), the
renderings may still suffer from aliasing and blurring artifacts, since it
remains a fundamental challenge to effectively and efficiently characterize
anisotropic areas induced by the cone-casting procedure. This paper introduces
a Ripmap-Encoded Platonic Solid representation to precisely and efficiently
featurize 3D anisotropic areas, achieving high-fidelity anti-aliasing
renderings. Central to our approach are two key components: Platonic Solid
Projection and Ripmap encoding. The Platonic Solid Projection factorizes the 3D
space onto the unparalleled faces of a certain Platonic solid, such that the
anisotropic 3D areas can be projected onto planes with distinguishable
characterization. Meanwhile, each face of the Platonic solid is encoded by the
Ripmap encoding, which is constructed by anisotropically pre-filtering a
learnable feature grid, to enable featurzing the projected anisotropic areas
both precisely and efficiently by the anisotropic area-sampling. Extensive
experiments on both well-established synthetic datasets and a newly captured
real-world dataset demonstrate that our Rip-NeRF attains state-of-the-art
rendering quality, particularly excelling in the fine details of repetitive
structures and textures, while maintaining relatively swift training times.

**Abstract**: We apply multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) to train end-to-end
robot soccer policies with fully onboard computation and sensing via egocentric
RGB vision. This setting reflects many challenges of real-world robotics,
including active perception, agile full-body control, and long-horizon planning
in a dynamic, partially-observable, multi-agent domain. We rely on large-scale,
simulation-based data generation to obtain complex behaviors from egocentric
vision which can be successfully transferred to physical robots using low-cost
sensors. To achieve adequate visual realism, our simulation combines rigid-body
physics with learned, realistic rendering via multiple Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRFs). We combine teacher-based multi-agent RL and cross-experiment data
reuse to enable the discovery of sophisticated soccer strategies. We analyze
active-perception behaviors including object tracking and ball seeking that
emerge when simply optimizing perception-agnostic soccer play. The agents
display equivalent levels of performance and agility as policies with access to
privileged, ground-truth state. To our knowledge, this paper constitutes a
first demonstration of end-to-end training for multi-agent robot soccer,
mapping raw pixel observations to joint-level actions, that can be deployed in
the real world. Videos of the game-play and analyses can be seen on our website

**Abstract**: In the fields of photogrammetry, computer vision and computer graphics, the
task of neural 3D scene reconstruction has led to the exploration of various
techniques. Among these, 3D Gaussian Splatting stands out for its explicit
representation of scenes using 3D Gaussians, making it appealing for tasks like
3D point cloud extraction and surface reconstruction. Motivated by its
potential, we address the domain of 3D scene reconstruction, aiming to leverage
the capabilities of the Microsoft HoloLens 2 for instant 3D Gaussian Splatting.
We present HoloGS, a novel workflow utilizing HoloLens sensor data, which
bypasses the need for pre-processing steps like Structure from Motion by
instantly accessing the required input data i.e. the images, camera poses and
the point cloud from depth sensing. We provide comprehensive investigations,
including the training process and the rendering quality, assessed through the
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, and the geometric 3D accuracy of the densified
point cloud from Gaussian centers, measured by Chamfer Distance. We evaluate
our approach on two self-captured scenes: An outdoor scene of a cultural
heritage statue and an indoor scene of a fine-structured plant. Our results
show that the HoloLens data, including RGB images, corresponding camera poses,
and depth sensing based point clouds to initialize the Gaussians, are suitable
as input for 3D Gaussian Splatting.

**Abstract**: The advances in the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) research offer extensive
applications in diverse domains, but protecting their copyrights has not yet
been researched in depth. Recently, NeRF watermarking has been considered one
of the pivotal solutions for safely deploying NeRF-based 3D representations.
However, existing methods are designed to apply only to implicit or explicit
NeRF representations. In this work, we introduce an innovative watermarking
method that can be employed in both representations of NeRF. This is achieved
by fine-tuning NeRF to embed binary messages in the rendering process. In
detail, we propose utilizing the discrete wavelet transform in the NeRF space
for watermarking. Furthermore, we adopt a deferred back-propagation technique
and introduce a combination with the patch-wise loss to improve rendering
quality and bit accuracy with minimum trade-offs. We evaluate our method in
three different aspects: capacity, invisibility, and robustness of the embedded
watermarks in the 2D-rendered images. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance with faster training speed over the compared state-of-the-art
methods.

**Abstract**: Meticulous 3D environment representations have been a longstanding goal in
computer vision and robotics fields. The recent emergence of neural implicit

advantages, such as simplified mathematical models, compact environment
storage, and continuous scene representations. Apart from computer vision, NeRF
has also shown tremendous potential in the field of robotics. Thus, we create
this survey to provide a comprehensive understanding of NeRF in the field of
robotics. By exploring the advantages and limitations of NeRF, as well as its
current applications and future potential, we hope to shed light on this
promising area of research. Our survey is divided into two main sections:
\textit{The Application of NeRF in Robotics} and \textit{The Advance of NeRF in
Robotics}, from the perspective of how NeRF enters the field of robotics. In
the first section, we introduce and analyze some works that have been or could
be used in the field of robotics from the perception and interaction
perspectives. In the second section, we show some works related to improving
NeRF's own properties, which are essential for deploying NeRF in the field of

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive results in 3D
reconstruction and generating novel views. A key challenge within NeRF is the
editing of reconstructed scenes, such as object removal, which requires
maintaining consistency across multiple views and ensuring high-quality
synthesised perspectives. Previous studies have incorporated depth priors,
typically from LiDAR or sparse depth measurements provided by COLMAP, to
improve the performance of object removal in NeRF. However, these methods are
either costly or time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
that integrates monocular depth estimates with NeRF-based object removal models
to significantly reduce time consumption and enhance the robustness and quality
of scene generation and object removal. We conducted a thorough evaluation of
COLMAP's dense depth reconstruction on the KITTI dataset to verify its accuracy
in depth map generation. Our findings suggest that COLMAP can serve as an
effective alternative to a ground truth depth map where such information is
missing or costly to obtain. Additionally, we integrated various monocular
depth estimation methods into the removal NeRF model, i.e., SpinNeRF, to assess
their capacity to improve object removal performance. Our experimental results
highlight the potential of monocular depth estimation to substantially improve
NeRF applications.

**Abstract**: Photorealistic simulation plays a crucial role in applications such as
autonomous driving, where advances in neural radiance fields (NeRFs) may allow
better scalability through the automatic creation of digital 3D assets.
However, reconstruction quality suffers on street scenes due to largely
collinear camera motions and sparser samplings at higher speeds. On the other
hand, the application often demands rendering from camera views that deviate
from the inputs to accurately simulate behaviors like lane changes. In this
paper, we propose several insights that allow a better utilization of Lidar
data to improve NeRF quality on street scenes. First, our framework learns a
geometric scene representation from Lidar, which is fused with the implicit
grid-based representation for radiance decoding, thereby supplying stronger
geometric information offered by explicit point cloud. Second, we put forth a
robust occlusion-aware depth supervision scheme, which allows utilizing
densified Lidar points by accumulation. Third, we generate augmented training
views from Lidar points for further improvement. Our insights translate to
largely improved novel view synthesis under real driving scenes.

**Abstract**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting, as a novel 3D representation, has garnered
attention for its fast rendering speed and high rendering quality. However,
this comes with high memory consumption, e.g., a well-trained Gaussian field
may utilize three million Gaussian primitives and over 700 MB of memory. We
credit this high memory footprint to the lack of consideration for the
relationship between primitives. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient
Gaussian field named SUNDAE with spectral pruning and neural compensation. On
one hand, we construct a graph on the set of Gaussian primitives to model their
relationship and design a spectral down-sampling module to prune out primitives
while preserving desired signals. On the other hand, to compensate for the
quality loss of pruning Gaussians, we exploit a lightweight neural network head
to mix splatted features, which effectively compensates for quality losses
while capturing the relationship between primitives in its weights. We
demonstrate the performance of SUNDAE with extensive results. For example,
SUNDAE can achieve 26.80 PSNR at 145 FPS using 104 MB memory while the vanilla
Gaussian splatting algorithm achieves 25.60 PSNR at 160 FPS using 523 MB
memory, on the Mip-NeRF360 dataset. Codes are publicly available at

**Abstract**: This paper focuses on training a robust RGB-D registration model without
ground-truth pose supervision. Existing methods usually adopt a pairwise
training strategy based on differentiable rendering, which enforces the
photometric and the geometric consistency between the two registered frames as
supervision. However, this frame-to-frame framework suffers from poor
multi-view consistency due to factors such as lighting changes, geometry
occlusion and reflective materials. In this paper, we present NeRF-UR, a novel
frame-to-model optimization framework for unsupervised RGB-D registration.
Instead of frame-to-frame consistency, we leverage the neural radiance field
(NeRF) as a global model of the scene and use the consistency between the input
and the NeRF-rerendered frames for pose optimization. This design can
significantly improve the robustness in scenarios with poor multi-view
consistency and provides better learning signal for the registration model.
Furthermore, to bootstrap the NeRF optimization, we create a synthetic dataset,
Sim-RGBD, through a photo-realistic simulator to warm up the registration
model. By first training the registration model on Sim-RGBD and later
unsupervisedly fine-tuning on real data, our framework enables distilling the
capability of feature extraction and registration from simulation to reality.
Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts on two popular indoor
RGB-D datasets, ScanNet and 3DMatch. Code and models will be released for paper
reproduction.
