**Abstract**: Novel view synthesis from a sparse set of input images is a challenging
problem of great practical interest, especially when camera poses are absent or
inaccurate. Direct optimization of camera poses and usage of estimated depths
in neural radiance field algorithms usually do not produce good results because
of the coupling between poses and depths, and inaccuracies in monocular depth
estimation. In this paper, we leverage the recent 3D Gaussian splatting method
to develop a novel construct-and-optimize method for sparse view synthesis
without camera poses. Specifically, we construct a solution progressively by
using monocular depth and projecting pixels back into the 3D world. During
construction, we optimize the solution by detecting 2D correspondences between
training views and the corresponding rendered images. We develop a unified
differentiable pipeline for camera registration and adjustment of both camera
poses and depths, followed by back-projection. We also introduce a novel notion
of an expected surface in Gaussian splatting, which is critical to our
optimization. These steps enable a coarse solution, which can then be low-pass
filtered and refined using standard optimization methods. We demonstrate
results on the Tanks and Temples and Static Hikes datasets with as few as three
widely-spaced views, showing significantly better quality than competing
methods, including those with approximate camera pose information. Moreover,
our results improve with more views and outperform previous InstantNGP and
Gaussian Splatting algorithms even when using half the dataset.

**Abstract**: Due to the limited model capacity, leveraging distributed Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRFs) for modeling extensive urban environments has become a
necessity. However, current distributed NeRF registration approaches encounter
aliasing artifacts, arising from discrepancies in rendering resolutions and
suboptimal pose precision. These factors collectively deteriorate the fidelity
of pose estimation within NeRF frameworks, resulting in occlusion artifacts
during the NeRF blending stage. In this paper, we present a distributed NeRF
system with tri-stage pose optimization. In the first stage, precise poses of
images are achieved by bundle adjusting Mip-NeRF 360 with a coarse-to-fine
strategy. In the second stage, we incorporate the inverting Mip-NeRF 360,
coupled with the truncated dynamic low-pass filter, to enable the achievement
of robust and precise poses, termed Frame2Model optimization. On top of this,
we obtain a coarse transformation between NeRFs in different coordinate
systems. In the third stage, we fine-tune the transformation between NeRFs by
Model2Model pose optimization. After obtaining precise transformation
parameters, we proceed to implement NeRF blending, showcasing superior
performance metrics in both real-world and simulation scenarios. Codes and data
will be publicly available at https://github.com/boilcy/Distributed-NeRF.

| 2024-05-05 | Honghua Chen, Chen Change Loy, Xingang Pan | cs.CV | [PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02859v1){: .btn .btn-green } |

**Abstract**: Despite the emergence of successful NeRF inpainting methods built upon
explicit RGB and depth 2D inpainting supervisions, these methods are inherently
constrained by the capabilities of their underlying 2D inpainters. This is due
to two key reasons: (i) independently inpainting constituent images results in
view-inconsistent imagery, and (ii) 2D inpainters struggle to ensure
high-quality geometry completion and alignment with inpainted RGB images.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach called MVIP-NeRF
that harnesses the potential of diffusion priors for NeRF inpainting,
addressing both appearance and geometry aspects. MVIP-NeRF performs joint
inpainting across multiple views to reach a consistent solution, which is
achieved via an iterative optimization process based on Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS). Apart from recovering the rendered RGB images, we also extract
normal maps as a geometric representation and define a normal SDS loss that
motivates accurate geometry inpainting and alignment with the appearance.
Additionally, we formulate a multi-view SDS score function to distill
generative priors simultaneously from different view images, ensuring
consistent visual completion when dealing with large view variations. Our
experimental results show better appearance and geometry recovery than previous
NeRF inpainting methods.

**Abstract**: In this paper, we present a new approach to bridge the domain gap between
synthetic and real-world data for un- manned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based
perception. Our formu- lation is designed for dynamic scenes, consisting of
moving objects or human actions, where the goal is to recognize the pose or
actions. We propose an extension of K-Planes Neural Radiance Field (NeRF),
wherein our algorithm stores a set of tiered feature vectors. The tiered
feature vectors are generated to effectively model conceptual information about
a scene as well as an image decoder that transforms output feature maps into
RGB images. Our technique leverages the information amongst both static and
dynamic objects within a scene and is able to capture salient scene attributes
of high altitude videos. We evaluate its performance on challenging datasets,
including Okutama Action and UG2, and observe considerable improvement in
accuracy over state of the art aerial perception algorithms.

**Abstract**: Active learning in 3D scene reconstruction has been widely studied, as
selecting informative training views is critical for the reconstruction.
Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) variants have shown performance
increases in active 3D reconstruction using image rendering or geometric
uncertainty. However, the simultaneous consideration of both uncertainties in
selecting informative views remains unexplored, while utilizing different types
of uncertainty can reduce the bias that arises in the early training stage with
sparse inputs. In this paper, we propose ActiveNeuS, which evaluates candidate
views considering both uncertainties. ActiveNeuS provides a way to accumulate
image rendering uncertainty while avoiding the bias that the estimated
densities can introduce. ActiveNeuS computes the neural implicit surface
uncertainty, providing the color uncertainty along with the surface
information. It efficiently handles the bias by using the surface information
and a grid, enabling the fast selection of diverse viewpoints. Our method
outperforms previous works on popular datasets, Blender and DTU, showing that
the views selected by ActiveNeuS significantly improve performance.

**Abstract**: Despite significant advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), the
renderings may still suffer from aliasing and blurring artifacts, since it
remains a fundamental challenge to effectively and efficiently characterize
anisotropic areas induced by the cone-casting procedure. This paper introduces
a Ripmap-Encoded Platonic Solid representation to precisely and efficiently
featurize 3D anisotropic areas, achieving high-fidelity anti-aliasing
renderings. Central to our approach are two key components: Platonic Solid
Projection and Ripmap encoding. The Platonic Solid Projection factorizes the 3D
space onto the unparalleled faces of a certain Platonic solid, such that the
anisotropic 3D areas can be projected onto planes with distinguishable
characterization. Meanwhile, each face of the Platonic solid is encoded by the
Ripmap encoding, which is constructed by anisotropically pre-filtering a
learnable feature grid, to enable featurzing the projected anisotropic areas
both precisely and efficiently by the anisotropic area-sampling. Extensive
experiments on both well-established synthetic datasets and a newly captured
real-world dataset demonstrate that our Rip-NeRF attains state-of-the-art
rendering quality, particularly excelling in the fine details of repetitive
structures and textures, while maintaining relatively swift training times.

**Abstract**: We apply multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) to train end-to-end
robot soccer policies with fully onboard computation and sensing via egocentric
RGB vision. This setting reflects many challenges of real-world robotics,
including active perception, agile full-body control, and long-horizon planning
in a dynamic, partially-observable, multi-agent domain. We rely on large-scale,
simulation-based data generation to obtain complex behaviors from egocentric
vision which can be successfully transferred to physical robots using low-cost
sensors. To achieve adequate visual realism, our simulation combines rigid-body
physics with learned, realistic rendering via multiple Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRFs). We combine teacher-based multi-agent RL and cross-experiment data
reuse to enable the discovery of sophisticated soccer strategies. We analyze
active-perception behaviors including object tracking and ball seeking that
emerge when simply optimizing perception-agnostic soccer play. The agents
display equivalent levels of performance and agility as policies with access to
privileged, ground-truth state. To our knowledge, this paper constitutes a
first demonstration of end-to-end training for multi-agent robot soccer,
mapping raw pixel observations to joint-level actions, that can be deployed in
the real world. Videos of the game-play and analyses can be seen on our website

**Abstract**: The advances in the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) research offer extensive
applications in diverse domains, but protecting their copyrights has not yet
been researched in depth. Recently, NeRF watermarking has been considered one
of the pivotal solutions for safely deploying NeRF-based 3D representations.
However, existing methods are designed to apply only to implicit or explicit
NeRF representations. In this work, we introduce an innovative watermarking
method that can be employed in both representations of NeRF. This is achieved
by fine-tuning NeRF to embed binary messages in the rendering process. In
detail, we propose utilizing the discrete wavelet transform in the NeRF space
for watermarking. Furthermore, we adopt a deferred back-propagation technique
and introduce a combination with the patch-wise loss to improve rendering
quality and bit accuracy with minimum trade-offs. We evaluate our method in
three different aspects: capacity, invisibility, and robustness of the embedded
watermarks in the 2D-rendered images. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance with faster training speed over the compared state-of-the-art
methods.

**Abstract**: In the fields of photogrammetry, computer vision and computer graphics, the
task of neural 3D scene reconstruction has led to the exploration of various
techniques. Among these, 3D Gaussian Splatting stands out for its explicit
representation of scenes using 3D Gaussians, making it appealing for tasks like
3D point cloud extraction and surface reconstruction. Motivated by its
potential, we address the domain of 3D scene reconstruction, aiming to leverage
the capabilities of the Microsoft HoloLens 2 for instant 3D Gaussian Splatting.
We present HoloGS, a novel workflow utilizing HoloLens sensor data, which
bypasses the need for pre-processing steps like Structure from Motion by
instantly accessing the required input data i.e. the images, camera poses and
the point cloud from depth sensing. We provide comprehensive investigations,
including the training process and the rendering quality, assessed through the
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, and the geometric 3D accuracy of the densified
point cloud from Gaussian centers, measured by Chamfer Distance. We evaluate
our approach on two self-captured scenes: An outdoor scene of a cultural
heritage statue and an indoor scene of a fine-structured plant. Our results
show that the HoloLens data, including RGB images, corresponding camera poses,
and depth sensing based point clouds to initialize the Gaussians, are suitable
as input for 3D Gaussian Splatting.

**Abstract**: Meticulous 3D environment representations have been a longstanding goal in
computer vision and robotics fields. The recent emergence of neural implicit
representations has introduced radical innovation to this field as implicit
representations enable numerous capabilities. Among these, the Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF) has sparked a trend because of the huge representational
advantages, such as simplified mathematical models, compact environment
storage, and continuous scene representations. Apart from computer vision, NeRF
has also shown tremendous potential in the field of robotics. Thus, we create
this survey to provide a comprehensive understanding of NeRF in the field of
robotics. By exploring the advantages and limitations of NeRF, as well as its
current applications and future potential, we hope to shed light on this
promising area of research. Our survey is divided into two main sections:
\textit{The Application of NeRF in Robotics} and \textit{The Advance of NeRF in
Robotics}, from the perspective of how NeRF enters the field of robotics. In
the first section, we introduce and analyze some works that have been or could
be used in the field of robotics from the perception and interaction
perspectives. In the second section, we show some works related to improving
NeRF's own properties, which are essential for deploying NeRF in the field of
robotics. In the discussion section of the review, we summarize the existing
challenges and provide some valuable future research directions for reference.

## NeRF-Guided Unsupervised Learning of RGB-D Registration

**Abstract**: This paper focuses on training a robust RGB-D registration model without
ground-truth pose supervision. Existing methods usually adopt a pairwise
training strategy based on differentiable rendering, which enforces the
photometric and the geometric consistency between the two registered frames as
supervision. However, this frame-to-frame framework suffers from poor
multi-view consistency due to factors such as lighting changes, geometry
occlusion and reflective materials. In this paper, we present NeRF-UR, a novel
frame-to-model optimization framework for unsupervised RGB-D registration.
Instead of frame-to-frame consistency, we leverage the neural radiance field
(NeRF) as a global model of the scene and use the consistency between the input
and the NeRF-rerendered frames for pose optimization. This design can
significantly improve the robustness in scenarios with poor multi-view
consistency and provides better learning signal for the registration model.
Furthermore, to bootstrap the NeRF optimization, we create a synthetic dataset,
Sim-RGBD, through a photo-realistic simulator to warm up the registration
model. By first training the registration model on Sim-RGBD and later
unsupervisedly fine-tuning on real data, our framework enables distilling the
capability of feature extraction and registration from simulation to reality.
Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts on two popular indoor
RGB-D datasets, ScanNet and 3DMatch. Code and models will be released for paper
reproduction.

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive results in 3D
reconstruction and generating novel views. A key challenge within NeRF is the
editing of reconstructed scenes, such as object removal, which requires
maintaining consistency across multiple views and ensuring high-quality
synthesised perspectives. Previous studies have incorporated depth priors,
typically from LiDAR or sparse depth measurements provided by COLMAP, to
improve the performance of object removal in NeRF. However, these methods are
either costly or time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
that integrates monocular depth estimates with NeRF-based object removal models
to significantly reduce time consumption and enhance the robustness and quality
of scene generation and object removal. We conducted a thorough evaluation of
COLMAP's dense depth reconstruction on the KITTI dataset to verify its accuracy
in depth map generation. Our findings suggest that COLMAP can serve as an
effective alternative to a ground truth depth map where such information is
missing or costly to obtain. Additionally, we integrated various monocular
depth estimation methods into the removal NeRF model, i.e., SpinNeRF, to assess
their capacity to improve object removal performance. Our experimental results
highlight the potential of monocular depth estimation to substantially improve
NeRF applications.

## Spectrally Pruned Gaussian Fields with Neural Compensation

**Abstract**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting, as a novel 3D representation, has garnered
attention for its fast rendering speed and high rendering quality. However,
this comes with high memory consumption, e.g., a well-trained Gaussian field
may utilize three million Gaussian primitives and over 700 MB of memory. We
credit this high memory footprint to the lack of consideration for the
relationship between primitives. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient
Gaussian field named SUNDAE with spectral pruning and neural compensation. On
one hand, we construct a graph on the set of Gaussian primitives to model their
relationship and design a spectral down-sampling module to prune out primitives
while preserving desired signals. On the other hand, to compensate for the
quality loss of pruning Gaussians, we exploit a lightweight neural network head
to mix splatted features, which effectively compensates for quality losses
while capturing the relationship between primitives in its weights. We
demonstrate the performance of SUNDAE with extensive results. For example,
SUNDAE can achieve 26.80 PSNR at 145 FPS using 104 MB memory while the vanilla
Gaussian splatting algorithm achieves 25.60 PSNR at 160 FPS using 523 MB
memory, on the Mip-NeRF360 dataset. Codes are publicly available at

**Abstract**: Photorealistic simulation plays a crucial role in applications such as
autonomous driving, where advances in neural radiance fields (NeRFs) may allow
better scalability through the automatic creation of digital 3D assets.
However, reconstruction quality suffers on street scenes due to largely
collinear camera motions and sparser samplings at higher speeds. On the other
hand, the application often demands rendering from camera views that deviate
from the inputs to accurately simulate behaviors like lane changes. In this
paper, we propose several insights that allow a better utilization of Lidar
data to improve NeRF quality on street scenes. First, our framework learns a
geometric scene representation from Lidar, which is fused with the implicit
grid-based representation for radiance decoding, thereby supplying stronger
geometric information offered by explicit point cloud. Second, we put forth a
robust occlusion-aware depth supervision scheme, which allows utilizing
densified Lidar points by accumulation. Third, we generate augmented training
views from Lidar points for further improvement. Our insights translate to
largely improved novel view synthesis under real driving scenes.
