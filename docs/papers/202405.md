**Abstract**: User-friendly 3D object editing is a challenging task that has attracted
significant attention recently. The limitations of direct 3D object editing
without 2D prior knowledge have prompted increased attention towards utilizing
2D generative models for 3D editing. While existing methods like Instruct
NeRF-to-NeRF offer a solution, they often lack user-friendliness, particularly
due to semantic guided editing. In the realm of 3D representation, 3D Gaussian
Splatting emerges as a promising approach for its efficiency and natural
explicit property, facilitating precise editing tasks. Building upon these
insights, we propose DragGaussian, a 3D object drag-editing framework based on
3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging diffusion models for interactive image
editing with open-vocabulary input. This framework enables users to perform
drag-based editing on pre-trained 3D Gaussian object models, producing modified
2D images through multi-view consistent editing. Our contributions include the
introduction of a new task, the development of DragGaussian for interactive
point-based 3D editing, and comprehensive validation of its effectiveness
through qualitative and quantitative experiments.

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for 3D
scene representation, offering high-fidelity renderings and reconstructions
from a set of sparse and unstructured sensor data. In the context of autonomous
robotics, where perception and understanding of the environment are pivotal,
NeRF holds immense promise for improving performance. In this paper, we present
a comprehensive survey and analysis of the state-of-the-art techniques for
utilizing NeRF to enhance the capabilities of autonomous robots. We especially
focus on the perception, localization and navigation, and decision-making
modules of autonomous robots and delve into tasks crucial for autonomous
operation, including 3D reconstruction, segmentation, pose estimation,
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), navigation and planning, and
interaction. Our survey meticulously benchmarks existing NeRF-based methods,
providing insights into their strengths and limitations. Moreover, we explore
promising avenues for future research and development in this domain. Notably,
we discuss the integration of advanced techniques such as 3D Gaussian splatting
(3DGS), large language models (LLM), and generative AIs, envisioning enhanced
reconstruction efficiency, scene understanding, decision-making capabilities.
This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to leverage NeRFs to
empower autonomous robots, paving the way for innovative solutions that can
navigate and interact seamlessly in complex environments.

**Abstract**: Text-driven 3D indoor scene generation holds broad applications, ranging from
gaming and smart homes to AR/VR applications. Fast and high-fidelity scene
generation is paramount for ensuring user-friendly experiences. However,
existing methods are characterized by lengthy generation processes or
necessitate the intricate manual specification of motion parameters, which
introduces inconvenience for users. Furthermore, these methods often rely on
narrow-field viewpoint iterative generations, compromising global consistency
and overall scene quality. To address these issues, we propose FastScene, a
framework for fast and higher-quality 3D scene generation, while maintaining
the scene consistency. Specifically, given a text prompt, we generate a
panorama and estimate its depth, since the panorama encompasses information
about the entire scene and exhibits explicit geometric constraints. To obtain
high-quality novel views, we introduce the Coarse View Synthesis (CVS) and
Progressive Novel View Inpainting (PNVI) strategies, ensuring both scene
consistency and view quality. Subsequently, we utilize Multi-View Projection
(MVP) to form perspective views, and apply 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for
scene reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate FastScene surpasses
other methods in both generation speed and quality with better scene
consistency. Notably, guided only by a text prompt, FastScene can generate a 3D
scene within a mere 15 minutes, which is at least one hour faster than
state-of-the-art methods, making it a paradigm for user-friendly scene
generation.

**Abstract**: Audio-driven talking head generation is advancing from 2D to 3D content.
Notably, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is in the spotlight as a means to
synthesize high-quality 3D talking head outputs. Unfortunately, this NeRF-based
approach typically requires a large number of paired audio-visual data for each
identity, thereby limiting the scalability of the method. Although there have
been attempts to generate audio-driven 3D talking head animations with a single
image, the results are often unsatisfactory due to insufficient information on
obscured regions in the image. In this paper, we mainly focus on addressing the
overlooked aspect of 3D consistency in the one-shot, audio-driven domain, where
facial animations are synthesized primarily in front-facing perspectives. We
propose a novel method, NeRFFaceSpeech, which enables to produce high-quality
3D-aware talking head. Using prior knowledge of generative models combined with
NeRF, our method can craft a 3D-consistent facial feature space corresponding
to a single image. Our spatial synchronization method employs audio-correlated
vertex dynamics of a parametric face model to transform static image features
into dynamic visuals through ray deformation, ensuring realistic 3D facial
motion. Moreover, we introduce LipaintNet that can replenish the lacking
information in the inner-mouth area, which can not be obtained from a given
single image. The network is trained in a self-supervised manner by utilizing
the generative capabilities without additional data. The comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in generating
audio-driven talking heads from a single image with enhanced 3D consistency
compared to previous approaches. In addition, we introduce a quantitative way
of measuring the robustness of a model against pose changes for the first time,
which has been possible only qualitatively.

**Abstract**: Point-based representations have recently gained popularity in novel view
synthesis, for their unique advantages, e.g., intuitive geometric
representation, simple manipulation, and faster convergence. However, based on
our observation, these point-based neural re-rendering methods are only
expected to perform well under ideal conditions and suffer from noisy, patchy
points and unbounded scenes, which are challenging to handle but defacto common
in real applications. To this end, we revisit one such influential method,
known as Neural Point-based Graphics (NPBG), as our baseline, and propose
Robust Point-based Graphics (RPBG). We in-depth analyze the factors that
prevent NPBG from achieving satisfactory renderings on generic datasets, and
accordingly reform the pipeline to make it more robust to varying datasets
in-the-wild. Inspired by the practices in image restoration, we greatly enhance
the neural renderer to enable the attention-based correction of point
visibility and the inpainting of incomplete rasterization, with only acceptable
overheads. We also seek for a simple and lightweight alternative for
environment modeling and an iterative method to alleviate the problem of poor
geometry. By thorough evaluation on a wide range of datasets with different
shooting conditions and camera trajectories, RPBG stably outperforms the
baseline by a large margin, and exhibits its great robustness over
state-of-the-art NeRF-based variants. Code available at

**Abstract**: Gaussian Splatting has garnered widespread attention due to its exceptional
performance. Consequently, SLAM systems based on Gaussian Splatting have
emerged, leveraging its capabilities for rapid real-time rendering and
high-fidelity mapping. However, current Gaussian Splatting SLAM systems usually
struggle with large scene representation and lack effective loop closure
adjustments and scene generalization capabilities. To address these issues, we
introduce NGM-SLAM, the first GS-SLAM system that utilizes neural radiance
field submaps for progressive scene expression, effectively integrating the
strengths of neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting. We have
developed neural implicit submaps as supervision and achieve high-quality scene
expression and online loop closure adjustments through Gaussian rendering of
fused submaps. Our results on multiple real-world scenes and large-scale scene
datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate gap filling and
high-quality scene expression, supporting both monocular, stereo, and RGB-D
inputs, and achieving state-of-the-art scene reconstruction and tracking
performance.

## GDGS: Gradient Domain Gaussian Splatting for Sparse Representation of  Radiance Fields

| 2024-05-08 | Yuanhao Gong | cs.CV | [PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05446v1){: .btn .btn-green } |

**Abstract**: The 3D Gaussian splatting methods are getting popular. However, they work
directly on the signal, leading to a dense representation of the signal. Even
with some techniques such as pruning or distillation, the results are still
dense. In this paper, we propose to model the gradient of the original signal.
The gradients are much sparser than the original signal. Therefore, the
gradients use much less Gaussian splats, leading to the more efficient storage
and thus higher computational performance during both training and rendering.
Thanks to the sparsity, during the view synthesis, only a small mount of pixels
are needed, leading to much higher computational performance ($100\sim
1000\times$ faster). And the 2D image can be recovered from the gradients via
solving a Poisson equation with linear computation complexity. Several
experiments are performed to confirm the sparseness of the gradients and the
computation performance of the proposed method. The method can be applied
various applications, such as human body modeling and indoor environment
modeling.

**Abstract**: Neural fields (NeRF) have emerged as a promising approach for representing
continuous 3D scenes. Nevertheless, the lack of semantic encoding in NeRFs
poses a significant challenge for scene decomposition. To address this
challenge, we present a single model, Multi-Modal Decomposition NeRF
(${M^2D}$NeRF), that is capable of both text-based and visual patch-based
edits. Specifically, we use multi-modal feature distillation to integrate
teacher features from pretrained visual and language models into 3D semantic
feature volumes, thereby facilitating consistent 3D editing. To enforce
consistency between the visual and language features in our 3D feature volumes,
we introduce a multi-modal similarity constraint. We also introduce a
patch-based joint contrastive loss that helps to encourage object-regions to
coalesce in the 3D feature space, resulting in more precise boundaries.
Experiments on various real-world scenes show superior performance in 3D scene
decomposition tasks compared to prior NeRF-based methods.

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have become a rapidly growing research field
with the potential to revolutionize typical photogrammetric workflows, such as
those used for 3D scene reconstruction. As input, NeRFs require multi-view
images with corresponding camera poses as well as the interior orientation. In
the typical NeRF workflow, the camera poses and the interior orientation are
estimated in advance with Structure from Motion (SfM). But the quality of the
resulting novel views, which depends on different parameters such as the number
and distribution of available images, as well as the accuracy of the related
camera poses and interior orientation, is difficult to predict. In addition,
SfM is a time-consuming pre-processing step, and its quality strongly depends
on the image content. Furthermore, the undefined scaling factor of SfM hinders
subsequent steps in which metric information is required. In this paper, we
evaluate the potential of NeRFs for industrial robot applications. We propose
an alternative to SfM pre-processing: we capture the input images with a
calibrated camera that is attached to the end effector of an industrial robot
and determine accurate camera poses with metric scale based on the robot
kinematics. We then investigate the quality of the novel views by comparing
them to ground truth, and by computing an internal quality measure based on
ensemble methods. For evaluation purposes, we acquire multiple datasets that
pose challenges for reconstruction typical of industrial applications, like
reflective objects, poor texture, and fine structures. We show that the
robot-based pose determination reaches similar accuracy as SfM in non-demanding
cases, while having clear advantages in more challenging scenarios. Finally, we
present first results of applying the ensemble method to estimate the quality
of the synthetic novel view in the absence of a ground truth.

## DistGrid: Scalable Scene Reconstruction with Distributed  Multi-resolution Hash Grid

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Field~(NeRF) achieves extremely high quality in object-scaled
and indoor scene reconstruction. However, there exist some challenges when
reconstructing large-scale scenes. MLP-based NeRFs suffer from limited network
capacity, while volume-based NeRFs are heavily memory-consuming when the scene
resolution increases. Recent approaches propose to geographically partition the
scene and learn each sub-region using an individual NeRF. Such partitioning
strategies help volume-based NeRF exceed the single GPU memory limit and scale
to larger scenes. However, this approach requires multiple background NeRF to
handle out-of-partition rays, which leads to redundancy of learning. Inspired
by the fact that the background of current partition is the foreground of
adjacent partition, we propose a scalable scene reconstruction method based on
joint Multi-resolution Hash Grids, named DistGrid. In this method, the scene is
divided into multiple closely-paved yet non-overlapped Axis-Aligned Bounding
Boxes, and a novel segmented volume rendering method is proposed to handle
cross-boundary rays, thereby eliminating the need for background NeRFs. The
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods on all
evaluated large-scale scenes, and provides visually plausible scene
reconstruction. The scalability of our method on reconstruction quality is
further evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively.

**Abstract**: We present Splat-MOVER, a modular robotics stack for open-vocabulary robotic
manipulation, which leverages the editability of Gaussian Splatting (GSplat)
scene representations to enable multi-stage manipulation tasks. Splat-MOVER
consists of: (i) $\textit{ASK-Splat}$, a GSplat representation that distills
latent codes for language semantics and grasp affordance into the 3D scene.
ASK-Splat enables geometric, semantic, and affordance understanding of 3D
scenes, which is critical for many robotics tasks; (ii) $\textit{SEE-Splat}$, a
real-time scene-editing module using 3D semantic masking and infilling to
visualize the motions of objects that result from robot interactions in the
real-world. SEE-Splat creates a "digital twin" of the evolving environment
throughout the manipulation task; and (iii) $\textit{Grasp-Splat}$, a grasp
generation module that uses ASK-Splat and SEE-Splat to propose candidate grasps
for open-world objects. ASK-Splat is trained in real-time from RGB images in a
brief scanning phase prior to operation, while SEE-Splat and Grasp-Splat run in
real-time during operation. We demonstrate the superior performance of
Splat-MOVER in hardware experiments on a Kinova robot compared to two recent
baselines in four single-stage, open-vocabulary manipulation tasks, as well as
in four multi-stage manipulation tasks using the edited scene to reflect scene
changes due to prior manipulation stages, which is not possible with the
existing baselines. Code for this project and a link to the project page will
be made available soon.

## A Construct-Optimize Approach to Sparse View Synthesis without Camera  Pose

**Abstract**: Novel view synthesis from a sparse set of input images is a challenging
problem of great practical interest, especially when camera poses are absent or
inaccurate. Direct optimization of camera poses and usage of estimated depths
in neural radiance field algorithms usually do not produce good results because
of the coupling between poses and depths, and inaccuracies in monocular depth
estimation. In this paper, we leverage the recent 3D Gaussian splatting method
to develop a novel construct-and-optimize method for sparse view synthesis
without camera poses. Specifically, we construct a solution progressively by
using monocular depth and projecting pixels back into the 3D world. During
construction, we optimize the solution by detecting 2D correspondences between
training views and the corresponding rendered images. We develop a unified
differentiable pipeline for camera registration and adjustment of both camera
poses and depths, followed by back-projection. We also introduce a novel notion
of an expected surface in Gaussian splatting, which is critical to our
optimization. These steps enable a coarse solution, which can then be low-pass
filtered and refined using standard optimization methods. We demonstrate
results on the Tanks and Temples and Static Hikes datasets with as few as three
widely-spaced views, showing significantly better quality than competing
methods, including those with approximate camera pose information. Moreover,
our results improve with more views and outperform previous InstantNGP and
Gaussian Splatting algorithms even when using half the dataset.

## MVIP-NeRF: Multi-view 3D Inpainting on NeRF Scenes via Diffusion Prior

| 2024-05-05 | Honghua Chen, Chen Change Loy, Xingang Pan | cs.CV | [PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02859v1){: .btn .btn-green } |

**Abstract**: Despite the emergence of successful NeRF inpainting methods built upon
explicit RGB and depth 2D inpainting supervisions, these methods are inherently
constrained by the capabilities of their underlying 2D inpainters. This is due
to two key reasons: (i) independently inpainting constituent images results in
view-inconsistent imagery, and (ii) 2D inpainters struggle to ensure
high-quality geometry completion and alignment with inpainted RGB images.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach called MVIP-NeRF
that harnesses the potential of diffusion priors for NeRF inpainting,
addressing both appearance and geometry aspects. MVIP-NeRF performs joint
inpainting across multiple views to reach a consistent solution, which is
achieved via an iterative optimization process based on Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS). Apart from recovering the rendered RGB images, we also extract
normal maps as a geometric representation and define a normal SDS loss that
motivates accurate geometry inpainting and alignment with the appearance.
Additionally, we formulate a multi-view SDS score function to distill
generative priors simultaneously from different view images, ensuring
consistent visual completion when dealing with large view variations. Our
experimental results show better appearance and geometry recovery than previous
NeRF inpainting methods.

**Abstract**: Due to the limited model capacity, leveraging distributed Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRFs) for modeling extensive urban environments has become a
necessity. However, current distributed NeRF registration approaches encounter
aliasing artifacts, arising from discrepancies in rendering resolutions and
suboptimal pose precision. These factors collectively deteriorate the fidelity
of pose estimation within NeRF frameworks, resulting in occlusion artifacts
during the NeRF blending stage. In this paper, we present a distributed NeRF
system with tri-stage pose optimization. In the first stage, precise poses of
images are achieved by bundle adjusting Mip-NeRF 360 with a coarse-to-fine
strategy. In the second stage, we incorporate the inverting Mip-NeRF 360,
coupled with the truncated dynamic low-pass filter, to enable the achievement
of robust and precise poses, termed Frame2Model optimization. On top of this,
we obtain a coarse transformation between NeRFs in different coordinate
systems. In the third stage, we fine-tune the transformation between NeRFs by
Model2Model pose optimization. After obtaining precise transformation
parameters, we proceed to implement NeRF blending, showcasing superior
performance metrics in both real-world and simulation scenarios. Codes and data
will be publicly available at https://github.com/boilcy/Distributed-NeRF.

**Abstract**: In this paper, we present a new approach to bridge the domain gap between
synthetic and real-world data for un- manned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based
perception. Our formu- lation is designed for dynamic scenes, consisting of
moving objects or human actions, where the goal is to recognize the pose or
actions. We propose an extension of K-Planes Neural Radiance Field (NeRF),
wherein our algorithm stores a set of tiered feature vectors. The tiered
feature vectors are generated to effectively model conceptual information about
a scene as well as an image decoder that transforms output feature maps into
RGB images. Our technique leverages the information amongst both static and
dynamic objects within a scene and is able to capture salient scene attributes
of high altitude videos. We evaluate its performance on challenging datasets,
including Okutama Action and UG2, and observe considerable improvement in
accuracy over state of the art aerial perception algorithms.

**Abstract**: Active learning in 3D scene reconstruction has been widely studied, as
selecting informative training views is critical for the reconstruction.
Recently, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) variants have shown performance
increases in active 3D reconstruction using image rendering or geometric
uncertainty. However, the simultaneous consideration of both uncertainties in
selecting informative views remains unexplored, while utilizing different types
of uncertainty can reduce the bias that arises in the early training stage with
sparse inputs. In this paper, we propose ActiveNeuS, which evaluates candidate
views considering both uncertainties. ActiveNeuS provides a way to accumulate
image rendering uncertainty while avoiding the bias that the estimated
densities can introduce. ActiveNeuS computes the neural implicit surface
uncertainty, providing the color uncertainty along with the surface
information. It efficiently handles the bias by using the surface information
and a grid, enabling the fast selection of diverse viewpoints. Our method
outperforms previous works on popular datasets, Blender and DTU, showing that
the views selected by ActiveNeuS significantly improve performance.

**Abstract**: Despite significant advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), the
renderings may still suffer from aliasing and blurring artifacts, since it
remains a fundamental challenge to effectively and efficiently characterize
anisotropic areas induced by the cone-casting procedure. This paper introduces
a Ripmap-Encoded Platonic Solid representation to precisely and efficiently
featurize 3D anisotropic areas, achieving high-fidelity anti-aliasing
renderings. Central to our approach are two key components: Platonic Solid
Projection and Ripmap encoding. The Platonic Solid Projection factorizes the 3D
space onto the unparalleled faces of a certain Platonic solid, such that the
anisotropic 3D areas can be projected onto planes with distinguishable
characterization. Meanwhile, each face of the Platonic solid is encoded by the
Ripmap encoding, which is constructed by anisotropically pre-filtering a
learnable feature grid, to enable featurzing the projected anisotropic areas
both precisely and efficiently by the anisotropic area-sampling. Extensive
experiments on both well-established synthetic datasets and a newly captured
real-world dataset demonstrate that our Rip-NeRF attains state-of-the-art
rendering quality, particularly excelling in the fine details of repetitive
structures and textures, while maintaining relatively swift training times.

**Abstract**: We apply multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) to train end-to-end
robot soccer policies with fully onboard computation and sensing via egocentric
RGB vision. This setting reflects many challenges of real-world robotics,
including active perception, agile full-body control, and long-horizon planning
in a dynamic, partially-observable, multi-agent domain. We rely on large-scale,
simulation-based data generation to obtain complex behaviors from egocentric
vision which can be successfully transferred to physical robots using low-cost
sensors. To achieve adequate visual realism, our simulation combines rigid-body
physics with learned, realistic rendering via multiple Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRFs). We combine teacher-based multi-agent RL and cross-experiment data
reuse to enable the discovery of sophisticated soccer strategies. We analyze
active-perception behaviors including object tracking and ball seeking that
emerge when simply optimizing perception-agnostic soccer play. The agents
display equivalent levels of performance and agility as policies with access to
privileged, ground-truth state. To our knowledge, this paper constitutes a
first demonstration of end-to-end training for multi-agent robot soccer,
mapping raw pixel observations to joint-level actions, that can be deployed in
the real world. Videos of the game-play and analyses can be seen on our website

**Abstract**: The advances in the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) research offer extensive
applications in diverse domains, but protecting their copyrights has not yet
been researched in depth. Recently, NeRF watermarking has been considered one
of the pivotal solutions for safely deploying NeRF-based 3D representations.
However, existing methods are designed to apply only to implicit or explicit
NeRF representations. In this work, we introduce an innovative watermarking
method that can be employed in both representations of NeRF. This is achieved
by fine-tuning NeRF to embed binary messages in the rendering process. In
detail, we propose utilizing the discrete wavelet transform in the NeRF space
for watermarking. Furthermore, we adopt a deferred back-propagation technique
and introduce a combination with the patch-wise loss to improve rendering
quality and bit accuracy with minimum trade-offs. We evaluate our method in
three different aspects: capacity, invisibility, and robustness of the embedded
watermarks in the 2D-rendered images. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance with faster training speed over the compared state-of-the-art
methods.

**Abstract**: In the fields of photogrammetry, computer vision and computer graphics, the
task of neural 3D scene reconstruction has led to the exploration of various
techniques. Among these, 3D Gaussian Splatting stands out for its explicit
representation of scenes using 3D Gaussians, making it appealing for tasks like
3D point cloud extraction and surface reconstruction. Motivated by its
potential, we address the domain of 3D scene reconstruction, aiming to leverage
the capabilities of the Microsoft HoloLens 2 for instant 3D Gaussian Splatting.
We present HoloGS, a novel workflow utilizing HoloLens sensor data, which
bypasses the need for pre-processing steps like Structure from Motion by
instantly accessing the required input data i.e. the images, camera poses and
the point cloud from depth sensing. We provide comprehensive investigations,
including the training process and the rendering quality, assessed through the
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, and the geometric 3D accuracy of the densified
point cloud from Gaussian centers, measured by Chamfer Distance. We evaluate
our approach on two self-captured scenes: An outdoor scene of a cultural
heritage statue and an indoor scene of a fine-structured plant. Our results
show that the HoloLens data, including RGB images, corresponding camera poses,
and depth sensing based point clouds to initialize the Gaussians, are suitable
as input for 3D Gaussian Splatting.

**Abstract**: Meticulous 3D environment representations have been a longstanding goal in
computer vision and robotics fields. The recent emergence of neural implicit
representations has introduced radical innovation to this field as implicit
representations enable numerous capabilities. Among these, the Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF) has sparked a trend because of the huge representational
advantages, such as simplified mathematical models, compact environment
storage, and continuous scene representations. Apart from computer vision, NeRF
has also shown tremendous potential in the field of robotics. Thus, we create
this survey to provide a comprehensive understanding of NeRF in the field of
robotics. By exploring the advantages and limitations of NeRF, as well as its
current applications and future potential, we hope to shed light on this
promising area of research. Our survey is divided into two main sections:
\textit{The Application of NeRF in Robotics} and \textit{The Advance of NeRF in
Robotics}, from the perspective of how NeRF enters the field of robotics. In
the first section, we introduce and analyze some works that have been or could
be used in the field of robotics from the perception and interaction
perspectives. In the second section, we show some works related to improving
NeRF's own properties, which are essential for deploying NeRF in the field of
robotics. In the discussion section of the review, we summarize the existing
challenges and provide some valuable future research directions for reference.

**Abstract**: This paper focuses on training a robust RGB-D registration model without
ground-truth pose supervision. Existing methods usually adopt a pairwise
training strategy based on differentiable rendering, which enforces the
photometric and the geometric consistency between the two registered frames as
supervision. However, this frame-to-frame framework suffers from poor
multi-view consistency due to factors such as lighting changes, geometry
occlusion and reflective materials. In this paper, we present NeRF-UR, a novel
frame-to-model optimization framework for unsupervised RGB-D registration.
Instead of frame-to-frame consistency, we leverage the neural radiance field
(NeRF) as a global model of the scene and use the consistency between the input
and the NeRF-rerendered frames for pose optimization. This design can
significantly improve the robustness in scenarios with poor multi-view
consistency and provides better learning signal for the registration model.
Furthermore, to bootstrap the NeRF optimization, we create a synthetic dataset,
Sim-RGBD, through a photo-realistic simulator to warm up the registration
model. By first training the registration model on Sim-RGBD and later
unsupervisedly fine-tuning on real data, our framework enables distilling the
capability of feature extraction and registration from simulation to reality.
Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts on two popular indoor
RGB-D datasets, ScanNet and 3DMatch. Code and models will be released for paper
reproduction.

**Abstract**: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting, as a novel 3D representation, has garnered
attention for its fast rendering speed and high rendering quality. However,
this comes with high memory consumption, e.g., a well-trained Gaussian field
may utilize three million Gaussian primitives and over 700 MB of memory. We
credit this high memory footprint to the lack of consideration for the
relationship between primitives. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient
Gaussian field named SUNDAE with spectral pruning and neural compensation. On
one hand, we construct a graph on the set of Gaussian primitives to model their
relationship and design a spectral down-sampling module to prune out primitives
while preserving desired signals. On the other hand, to compensate for the
quality loss of pruning Gaussians, we exploit a lightweight neural network head
to mix splatted features, which effectively compensates for quality losses
while capturing the relationship between primitives in its weights. We
demonstrate the performance of SUNDAE with extensive results. For example,
SUNDAE can achieve 26.80 PSNR at 145 FPS using 104 MB memory while the vanilla
Gaussian splatting algorithm achieves 25.60 PSNR at 160 FPS using 523 MB
memory, on the Mip-NeRF360 dataset. Codes are publicly available at

**Abstract**: Photorealistic simulation plays a crucial role in applications such as
autonomous driving, where advances in neural radiance fields (NeRFs) may allow
better scalability through the automatic creation of digital 3D assets.
However, reconstruction quality suffers on street scenes due to largely
collinear camera motions and sparser samplings at higher speeds. On the other
hand, the application often demands rendering from camera views that deviate
from the inputs to accurately simulate behaviors like lane changes. In this
paper, we propose several insights that allow a better utilization of Lidar
data to improve NeRF quality on street scenes. First, our framework learns a
geometric scene representation from Lidar, which is fused with the implicit
grid-based representation for radiance decoding, thereby supplying stronger
geometric information offered by explicit point cloud. Second, we put forth a
robust occlusion-aware depth supervision scheme, which allows utilizing
densified Lidar points by accumulation. Third, we generate augmented training
views from Lidar points for further improvement. Our insights translate to
largely improved novel view synthesis under real driving scenes.

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive results in 3D
reconstruction and generating novel views. A key challenge within NeRF is the
editing of reconstructed scenes, such as object removal, which requires
maintaining consistency across multiple views and ensuring high-quality
synthesised perspectives. Previous studies have incorporated depth priors,
typically from LiDAR or sparse depth measurements provided by COLMAP, to
improve the performance of object removal in NeRF. However, these methods are
either costly or time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
that integrates monocular depth estimates with NeRF-based object removal models
to significantly reduce time consumption and enhance the robustness and quality
of scene generation and object removal. We conducted a thorough evaluation of
COLMAP's dense depth reconstruction on the KITTI dataset to verify its accuracy
in depth map generation. Our findings suggest that COLMAP can serve as an
effective alternative to a ground truth depth map where such information is
missing or costly to obtain. Additionally, we integrated various monocular
depth estimation methods into the removal NeRF model, i.e., SpinNeRF, to assess
their capacity to improve object removal performance. Our experimental results
highlight the potential of monocular depth estimation to substantially improve
NeRF applications.
