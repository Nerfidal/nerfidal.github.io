**Abstract**: We present FalconWing -- an open-source, ultra-lightweight (150 g) fixed-wing
platform for autonomy research. The hardware platform integrates a small
camera, a standard airframe, offboard computation, and radio communication for
manual overrides. We demonstrate FalconWing's capabilities by developing and
deploying a purely vision-based control policy for autonomous landing (without
IMU or motion capture) using a novel real-to-sim-to-real learning approach. Our
learning approach: (1) constructs a photorealistic simulation environment via
3D Gaussian splatting trained on real-world images; (2) identifies nonlinear
dynamics from vision-estimated real-flight data; and (3) trains a multi-modal
Vision Transformer (ViT) policy through simulation-only imitation learning. The
ViT architecture fuses single RGB image with the history of control actions via
self-attention, preserving temporal context while maintaining real-time 20 Hz
inference. When deployed zero-shot on the hardware platform, this policy
achieves an 80% success rate in vision-based autonomous landings. Together with
the hardware specifications, we also open-source the system dynamics, the
software for photorealistic simulator and the learning approach.

**Abstract**: Online reconstruction of dynamic scenes is significant as it enables learning
scenes from live-streaming video inputs, while existing offline dynamic
reconstruction methods rely on recorded video inputs. However, previous online
reconstruction approaches have primarily focused on efficiency and rendering
quality, overlooking the temporal consistency of their results, which often
contain noticeable artifacts in static regions. This paper identifies that
errors such as noise in real-world recordings affect temporal inconsistency in
online reconstruction. We propose a method that enhances temporal consistency
in online reconstruction from observations with temporal inconsistency which is
inevitable in cameras. We show that our method restores the ideal observation
by subtracting the learned error. We demonstrate that applying our method to
various baselines significantly enhances both temporal consistency and
rendering quality across datasets. Code, video results, and checkpoints are
available at https://bbangsik13.github.io/OR2.

**Abstract**: High-quality, animatable 3D human avatar reconstruction from monocular videos
offers significant potential for reducing reliance on complex hardware, making
it highly practical for applications in game development, augmented reality,
and social media. However, existing methods still face substantial challenges
in capturing fine geometric details and maintaining animation stability,
particularly under dynamic or complex poses. To address these issues, we
propose a novel real-time framework for animatable human avatar reconstruction
based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). By leveraging 2DGS and global SMPL pose
parameters, our framework not only aligns positional and rotational
discrepancies but also enables robust and natural pose-driven animation of the
reconstructed avatars. Furthermore, we introduce a Rotation Compensation
Network (RCN) that learns rotation residuals by integrating local geometric
features with global pose parameters. This network significantly improves the
handling of non-rigid deformations and ensures smooth, artifact-free pose
transitions during animation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
successfully reconstructs realistic and highly animatable human avatars from
monocular videos, effectively preserving fine-grained details while ensuring
stable and natural pose variation. Our approach surpasses current
state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and animation
robustness on public benchmarks.

| 2025-05-01 | Feng Xue, Wenzhuang Xu, Guofeng Zhong, Anlong Minga, Nicu Sebe | cs.CV | [PDF](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00378v1){: .btn .btn-green } |

**Abstract**: Open-vocabulary 3D panoptic segmentation has recently emerged as a
significant trend. Top-performing methods currently integrate 2D segmentation
with geometry-aware 3D primitives. However, the advantage would be lost without
high-fidelity 3D point clouds, such as methods based on Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF). These methods are limited by the insufficient capacity to maintain
consistency across partial observations. To address this, recent works have
utilized contrastive loss or cross-view association pre-processing for view
consensus. In contrast to them, we present Cues3D, a compact approach that
relies solely on NeRF instead of pre-associations. The core idea is that NeRF's
implicit 3D field inherently establishes a globally consistent geometry,
enabling effective object distinction without explicit cross-view supervision.
We propose a three-phase training framework for NeRF,
initialization-disambiguation-refinement, whereby the instance IDs are
corrected using the initially-learned knowledge. Additionally, an instance
disambiguation method is proposed to match NeRF-rendered 3D masks and ensure
globally unique 3D instance identities. With the aid of Cues3D, we obtain
highly consistent and unique 3D instance ID for each object across views with a
balanced version of NeRF. Our experiments are conducted on ScanNet v2,
ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and Replica datasets for 3D instance, panoptic, and
semantic segmentation tasks. Cues3D outperforms other 2D image-based methods
and competes with the latest 2D-3D merging based methods, while even surpassing
them when using additional 3D point clouds. The code link could be found in the
appendix and will be released on
