**Abstract**: Despite the photorealistic novel view synthesis (NVS) performance achieved by
the original 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), its rendering quality significantly
degrades with sparse input views. This performance drop is mainly caused by the
limited number of initial points generated from the sparse input, insufficient
supervision during the training process, and inadequate regularization of the
oversized Gaussian ellipsoids. To handle these issues, we propose the
LoopSparseGS, a loop-based 3DGS framework for the sparse novel view synthesis
task. In specific, we propose a loop-based Progressive Gaussian Initialization
(PGI) strategy that could iteratively densify the initialized point cloud using
the rendered pseudo images during the training process. Then, the sparse and
reliable depth from the Structure from Motion, and the window-based dense
monocular depth are leveraged to provide precise geometric supervision via the
proposed Depth-alignment Regularization (DAR). Additionally, we introduce a
novel Sparse-friendly Sampling (SFS) strategy to handle oversized Gaussian
ellipsoids leading to large pixel errors. Comprehensive experiments on four
datasets demonstrate that LoopSparseGS outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods for sparse-input novel view synthesis, across indoor, outdoor, and
object-level scenes with various image resolutions.
