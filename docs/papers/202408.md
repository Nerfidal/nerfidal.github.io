**Abstract**: The rice panicle traits significantly influence grain yield, making them a
primary target for rice phenotyping studies. However, most existing techniques
are limited to controlled indoor environments and difficult to capture the rice
panicle traits under natural growth conditions. Here, we developed PanicleNeRF,
a novel method that enables high-precision and low-cost reconstruction of rice
panicle three-dimensional (3D) models in the field using smartphone. The
proposed method combined the large model Segment Anything Model (SAM) and the
small model You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8) to achieve high-precision
segmentation of rice panicle images. The NeRF technique was then employed for
3D reconstruction using the images with 2D segmentation. Finally, the resulting
point clouds are processed to successfully extract panicle traits. The results
show that PanicleNeRF effectively addressed the 2D image segmentation task,
achieving a mean F1 Score of 86.9% and a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of
79.8%, with nearly double the boundary overlap (BO) performance compared to
YOLOv8. As for point cloud quality, PanicleNeRF significantly outperformed
traditional SfM-MVS (structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo) methods, such
as COLMAP and Metashape. The panicle length was then accurately extracted with
the rRMSE of 2.94% for indica and 1.75% for japonica rice. The panicle volume
estimated from 3D point clouds strongly correlated with the grain number (R2 =
0.85 for indica and 0.82 for japonica) and grain mass (0.80 for indica and 0.76
for japonica). This method provides a low-cost solution for high-throughput
in-field phenotyping of rice panicles, accelerating the efficiency of rice
breeding.

**Abstract**: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) achieve impressive rendering performance by
learning volumetric 3D representation from several images of different views.
However, it is difficult to reconstruct a sharp NeRF from blurry input as it
often occurs in the wild. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Efficient
Event-Enhanced NeRF (E$^3$NeRF) by utilizing the combination of RGB images and
event streams. To effectively introduce event streams into the neural
volumetric representation learning process, we propose an event-enhanced blur
rendering loss and an event rendering loss, which guide the network via
modeling the real blur process and event generation process, respectively.
Specifically, we leverage spatial-temporal information from the event stream to
evenly distribute learning attention over temporal blur while simultaneously
focusing on blurry texture through the spatial attention. Moreover, a camera
pose estimation framework for real-world data is built with the guidance of the
events to generalize the method to practical applications. Compared to previous
image-based or event-based NeRF, our framework makes more profound use of the
internal relationship between events and images. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate that E$^3$NeRF can effectively
learn a sharp NeRF from blurry images, especially in non-uniform motion and
low-light scenes.

**Abstract**: Previous studies aiming to optimize and bundle-adjust camera poses using
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), such as BARF and DBARF, have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in 3D scene reconstruction. However, these approaches
have been designed for pinhole-camera pose optimization and do not perform well
under radial image distortions such as those in fisheye cameras. Furthermore,
inaccurate depth initialization in DBARF results in erroneous geometric
information affecting the overall convergence and quality of results. In this
paper, we propose adaptive GRUs with a flexible bundle-adjustment method
adapted to radial distortions and incorporate feature-based recurrent neural
networks to generate continuous novel views from fisheye datasets. Other NeRF
methods for fisheye images, such as SCNeRF and OMNI-NeRF, use projected ray
distance loss for distorted pose refinement, causing severe artifacts, long
rendering time, and are difficult to use in downstream tasks, where the dense
voxel representation generated by a NeRF method needs to be converted into a
mesh representation. We also address depth initialization issues by adding
MiDaS-based depth priors for pinhole images. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the generalization capacity of FBINeRF and show high-fidelity
results for both pinhole-camera and fisheye-camera NeRFs.

## A General Framework to Boost 3D GS Initialization for Text-to-3D  Generation by Lexical Richness

**Abstract**: Text-to-3D content creation has recently received much attention, especially
with the prevalence of 3D Gaussians Splatting. In general, GS-based methods
comprise two key stages: initialization and rendering optimization. To achieve
initialization, existing works directly apply random sphere initialization or
3D diffusion models, e.g., Point-E, to derive the initial shapes. However, such
strategies suffer from two critical yet challenging problems: 1) the final
shapes are still similar to the initial ones even after training; 2) shapes can
be produced only from simple texts, e.g., "a dog", not for lexically richer
texts, e.g., "a dog is sitting on the top of the airplane". To address these
problems, this paper proposes a novel general framework to boost the 3D GS
Initialization for text-to-3D generation upon the lexical richness. Our key
idea is to aggregate 3D Gaussians into spatially uniform voxels to represent
complex shapes while enabling the spatial interaction among the 3D Gaussians
and semantic interaction between Gaussians and texts. Specifically, we first
construct a voxelized representation, where each voxel holds a 3D Gaussian with
its position, scale, and rotation fixed while setting opacity as the sole
factor to determine a position's occupancy. We then design an initialization
network mainly consisting of two novel components: 1) Global Information
Perception (GIP) block and 2) Gaussians-Text Fusion (GTF) block. Such a design
enables each 3D Gaussian to assimilate the spatial information from other areas
and semantic information from texts. Extensive experiments show the superiority
of our framework of high-quality 3D GS initialization against the existing
methods, e.g., Shap-E, by taking lexically simple, medium, and hard texts.
Also, our framework can be seamlessly plugged into SoTA training frameworks,
e.g., LucidDreamer, for semantically consistent text-to-3D generation.

**Abstract**: We introduce Reality Fusion, a novel robot teleoperation system that
localizes, streams, projects, and merges a typical onboard depth sensor with a
photorealistic, high resolution, high framerate, and wide field of view (FoV)
rendering of the complex remote environment represented as 3D Gaussian splats
(3DGS). Our framework enables robust egocentric and exocentric robot
teleoperation in immersive VR, with the 3DGS effectively extending spatial
information of a depth sensor with limited FoV and balancing the trade-off
between data streaming costs and data visual quality. We evaluated our
framework through a user study with 24 participants, which revealed that
Reality Fusion leads to significantly better user performance, situation
awareness, and user preferences. To support further research and development,
we provide an open-source implementation with an easy-to-replicate custom-made
telepresence robot, a high-performance virtual reality 3DGS renderer, and an
immersive robot control package. (Source code:

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently shown promising results as an alternative
scene representation in SLAM systems to neural implicit representations.
However, current methods either lack dense depth maps to supervise the mapping
process or detailed training designs that consider the scale of the
environment. To address these drawbacks, we present IG-SLAM, a dense RGB-only
SLAM system that employs robust Dense-SLAM methods for tracking and combines
them with Gaussian Splatting. A 3D map of the environment is constructed using
accurate pose and dense depth provided by tracking. Additionally, we utilize
depth uncertainty in map optimization to improve 3D reconstruction. Our decay
strategy in map optimization enhances convergence and allows the system to run
at 10 fps in a single process. We demonstrate competitive performance with
state-of-the-art RGB-only SLAM systems while achieving faster operation speeds.
We present our experiments on the Replica, TUM-RGBD, ScanNet, and EuRoC
datasets. The system achieves photo-realistic 3D reconstruction in large-scale
sequences, particularly in the EuRoC dataset.

**Abstract**: This paper investigates the utility of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) models
in extending the regions of operation of a mobile robot, controlled by
Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS) via static CCTV cameras. Using NeRF as a
3D-representation prior, the robot's footprint may be extrapolated
geometrically and used to train a CNN-based network to extract it online from
the robot's appearance alone. The resulting footprint results in a tighter
bound than a robot-wide bounding box, allowing the robot's controller to
prescribe more optimal trajectories and expand its safe operational floor area.

**Abstract**: Three-dimensional ultrasound imaging is a critical technology widely used in
medical diagnostics. However, traditional 3D ultrasound imaging methods have
limitations such as fixed resolution, low storage efficiency, and insufficient
contextual connectivity, leading to poor performance in handling complex
artifacts and reflection characteristics. Recently, techniques based on NeRF
(Neural Radiance Fields) have made significant progress in view synthesis and
3D reconstruction, but there remains a research gap in high-quality ultrasound
imaging. To address these issues, we propose a new model, UlRe-NeRF, which
combines implicit neural networks and explicit ultrasound volume rendering into
an ultrasound neural rendering architecture. This model incorporates reflection
direction parameterization and harmonic encoding, using a directional MLP
module to generate view-dependent high-frequency reflection intensity
estimates, and a spatial MLP module to produce the medium's physical property
parameters. These parameters are used in the volume rendering process to
accurately reproduce the propagation and reflection behavior of ultrasound
waves in the medium. Experimental results demonstrate that the UlRe-NeRF model
significantly enhances the realism and accuracy of high-fidelity ultrasound
image reconstruction, especially in handling complex medium structures.

**Abstract**: Despite the photorealistic novel view synthesis (NVS) performance achieved by
the original 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), its rendering quality significantly
degrades with sparse input views. This performance drop is mainly caused by the
limited number of initial points generated from the sparse input, insufficient
supervision during the training process, and inadequate regularization of the
oversized Gaussian ellipsoids. To handle these issues, we propose the
LoopSparseGS, a loop-based 3DGS framework for the sparse novel view synthesis
task. In specific, we propose a loop-based Progressive Gaussian Initialization
(PGI) strategy that could iteratively densify the initialized point cloud using
the rendered pseudo images during the training process. Then, the sparse and
reliable depth from the Structure from Motion, and the window-based dense
monocular depth are leveraged to provide precise geometric supervision via the
proposed Depth-alignment Regularization (DAR). Additionally, we introduce a
novel Sparse-friendly Sampling (SFS) strategy to handle oversized Gaussian
ellipsoids leading to large pixel errors. Comprehensive experiments on four
datasets demonstrate that LoopSparseGS outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods for sparse-input novel view synthesis, across indoor, outdoor, and
object-level scenes with various image resolutions.
